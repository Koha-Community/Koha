TRANSLATION TOOL , V2.0:
============
This transation tool should greatly help Koha translators.
It's composed of 2 script :
* test-extract.pl, that extracts the texts in a template. It is called by
* tmpl_process.
tmpl process can do 3 things :
- create a file with all sentences all files in a directory (& it's subdirectories)
- update an existing translation file.
- rebuild translated templates from english & translation file.

Call tmpl_process --help to get full explanations.

HOW TO TRANSLATE Koha :
============
1- create your translation file :
./tmpl_process.pl create -i /home/paul/koha.dev/koha/koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/en/ -s opac.fr -r
2- translate your opac.fr file (english & other_language being separated by a tab, using IGNORE and LIMITED pragmas, see below)
3- create your translated version :
./tmpl_process.pl install -i /home/paul/koha.dev/koha/koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/en/ -o /home/paul/koha.dev/koha/koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/fr2/ -s opac.fr -r
4- copy images/css files in your new directory (as they are NOT moved by tmpl_process.pl install)

If something changes in english version :
1- update your translation file :
./tmpl_process.pl update -i /home/paul/koha.dev/koha/koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/en/ -s opac.fr -r
2- translate new  your opac.fr file (english & other_language being separated by a tab, using IGNORE and LIMITED pragmas, see below)
3- create your translated version :
./tmpl_process.pl install -i /home/paul/koha.dev/koha/koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/en/ -o /home/paul/koha.dev/koha/koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/fr2/ -s opac.fr -r
4- copy new images/css files in your new directory if needed

WEAKNESSES
=======
I've found some weaknesses (some solvable probably, but maybe some unsolvable)
- HTML::Templates pb :
 if there is only a <TMPL* > tag between 2 strings, text-extract sometimes merges both strings, and so can't replace them in the translated template. I've solved all those cases with a <br/> or another HTML statement.
  The text-extract2.pl filter attempts to address this problem; it seems that the new filter is now working correctly.

- SHORT STATEMENTS
 short statements (like "in") can be replaced stupidly (like in cgi-bin => gives cgi-bdans in french). the workaround has been to replace only complete words (
line 185 of tmpl_process :
$line =~ s/(\W)$text(\W)/$1$subst$2/g;
)
Don't seem to have any side effect.

- WORD exist in FILENAME
words that are in the templates and in a perl script name are replaced !
For example : Search is replace by Recherche in french, thus,giving <a href="cgi-bin/opac-Recherche.pl">, which is wrong...
2 ways to solve this problem, IGNORE & LIMITED pragma.
IGNORE :
if a line in translation file is :
this_original_string	IGNORE
it is ignored during translation.
LIMITED :
if a line in translation file is :
this_original_string LIMITED;the_translation_string
The string is translated only if :
* has a > just before
* has <space>title=" just before
* has <space>alt=" just before.
This prevent stupid replaces, at the cost of some missing translation maybe.

- MISSING STRINGS
Maybe some strings that should be translated are missing.
You can add whatever you want in text-extract.pl.
For instance, it extracts :
- standard text
- text in alt="SOMETEXT"
- meta html encoding (8859-1) to enable non european translations.

- DIFFERENT WORD ORDER
Some languages have different word order than English in sentences, or even in dates. For these languages, it is impossible to make a good translation at the moment.
