=head1 SYNOPSIS

  sitemap.pl --verbose
  sitemap.pl --noshort --url /home/koha/mylibrary/www

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Process all biblio records from a Koha instance and generate Sitemap files
complying with this protocol as described on L<http://sitemaps.org>. The goal of
this script is to be able to provide to search engines direct access to biblio
records. It avoid leaving search engine browsing Koha OPAC and so generating
a lot of traffic, and workload, for a bad result.

A file name F<sitemapindex.xml> is generated. It contains references to Sitemap
multiples files. Each file contains at most 50,000 urls, and is named
F<sitemapXXXX.xml>.

The files must be stored on Koha OPAC root directory, ie
F<<koha-root>/koha-tmpl/>. Place also in this directory a F<robots.txt> file
like this one:

 Sitemap: sitemapindex.xml
 User-agent: *
 Disallow: /cgi-bin/

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over

=item B<--url=Koha OPAC base URL>

=item B<--short|noshort>

/bib/biblionumber. With --noshort, URL ends with
/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=bibnum

=item B<--dir>

Directory where to write sitemap files. By default, the current directory.
