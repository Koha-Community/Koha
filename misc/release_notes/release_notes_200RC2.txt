RELEASE NOTES
=============
This version of Koha is the second in the 2.0 "stable" series.
It does not mean that it has no bugs, but many libraries are using it and don't encounter unsolvable problems.
If you want to adopt Koha, please do, but you're warned that this release candidate version may still have some bugs and missing features.
If you test it and let us know about any we haven't seen yet, it will help us to fix them.

The 2.0.x series version is "feature freezed". Only bugs or minor changes will be made in this branch.
The koha team is already working on the 2.2.x version. In CVS (HEAD branch), developers can already get 1st draft of a working z3950 server.

BUGFIXES/IMPROVEMENTS

BUGS FIXED:
* 318 : allow or not a book to be loan
* 537 : in borrower screen, the "fine & debts" now shows only amount due if >0, "nothing due" if borrower has no debts.
* 557 : spelling error in message for no search criteria entered
* 564 : Member card number not checked unique
* 586 : additem.tmpl displays incorrect biblio number
* 605 : circulation.pl only shows one waiting item (1 small problem remaining, see bugs.koha.org)
* 614 : opac-user.pl doesn't show which items are waiting
* 625 : dateformat under system prefs is confusing
* 646 : Member flag must be either 'parameters' or 'superlibrarian' to log in (now, any flag enable login)
* 662 : poor SQL calls, that could be used for SQL injection (security problem)
* 671 : Add institutional member confirmation screen has no details
* 672 : readingrec can not be reordered
* 675 : "logged in" info missing
* 683 : Search for barcode or illustrator says ' You did not specify any seach criteria'
* minor HTML modifs & tweaks
* minor improvements/bugfixes in installer
* biblio & item deletion bugs fixed.
* bug fixed in MARC editor, that appeared on specific MARC configuration & makes biblio adding impossible.


IMPROVEMENTS:
* z3950 client daemon improved a lot : many deadlock situations solved, improved problem reporting, ignoring invalid z3950 servers (or server not responding)
* new french translation. Note that only english and french are up to date. Other won't work, probably. Note also that a tool for translator is now ready, and should ease a lot translating and maintaining translations.
* new OPAC theme. it's called "css". It's a XHTML1.0 strict OPAC. In librarian interface, just change systempref opactheme to css to get it. Will be the default opac in 2.2
* publisher added in acquisition process (the one with basket & supplier) Basket now ordered by publisher.
* notforloan field management added in itemtype administration screen
* new migration script : misc/rebuildthesaurus.pl => this script can rebuild thesaurus/authority file after importing records with misc/bulkmarcimport.pl

DB change :
*index added into z3950results table UNIQUE KEY query_server (queryid,server)  (added by installer & updater)

KNOWN BUGS :
* MARC upload fails silently (in breeding farm) if the file provided is not iso2709 (works fine with a valid file)
* autobarcode not calculated even if autobarcode system parameter is set and MARC=on.
* the MARC21 english default parameter setup is working, but some librarians reports that some choices are poor. If you use MARC21, tweak some setups to fit your needs.
