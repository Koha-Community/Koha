IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT CONCERNING 3.2.x EOL
========================================================================
With the release of 3.4.0, the 3.2.x branch is nearing its EOL.
After 3.2.10 or 04/15/2011, a motion will be made at the August 2011
general IRC meeting to officially announce EOL for the 3.2.x branch.
Please keep this in mind when planning new deployments and upgrades to
existing systems.

Highlights of 3.2.9
======================

NOTE: This release is a security release. It is strongly recommended that users apply
this upgrade immediately to production systems. If you are installing a new system, please
use this version rather than earlier versions.

System Requirements
======================

    Changes since 3.0:

    * The minimum version of Perl required is now 5.8.8.
    * There are a number of new Perl module dependencies.
      Run ./koha_perl_deps.pl -u -m to get a list of
      any new modules to install during upgrade.

Upgrades
======================

The structure of the acquisitions tables have changed significantly
from 3.0.x.  In particular, the budget hierarchy is quite different.
During an upgrade, a new database table is created called fundmapping
that contains a record of how budgets were mapped.  It is strongly
recommended that users of Koha 3.0.x acquisitions carefully review
the results of the upgrade before resuming ordering in Koha 3.2.x.
