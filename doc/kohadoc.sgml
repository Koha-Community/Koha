     This is the full documentation set for the Koha Library application suite.  All of the information found in subsets of the documentation (ie the INSTALL file) are contained in this file.  It is conveniently grouped into 3 major sections, plus appendices, intended for the three broad classes of reader the developers and documenters anticipate.  Happy Cataloging!

  <para>
   Koha is a library cataloging application, originally created for the Horowhenua Library Trust by Katipo, a small company in New Zealand.  It has always been under the Gnu Public License, and today is installed as a production system in at least 4 countries indexing thousands of individual library items, and currently supports users in 2 languages.  New features and support are handled by a variety of international volunteers.

  <title>Welcome to Koha</title>
  <para>
  Dear User,</para>
  <para>Hello, and welcome to Koha.  The manual you're reading and the software that it documents are the fruits of a lot of volunteer labor, hard work by the staff of Katipo Communications, and donations by Horowhenua Library Trust and other libraries.</para>

<para> Koha was initially developed in 1999 and the first library went live in January of 2000.  Koha's code has been in production since then and is continuing to move towards higher levels of functionality and standards compliance, including embracing the international records and cataloging standards MARC and Z39.50.  Our development community has also grown and now includes contributors on four continents and ports in several languages.</para>

<para>This is one of the beauties of Free Software -- all of the people involved have reasons to work on a Library System, by working together they've been able to create something far more useful than anything they could have done on their own, while enjoying the benefits of all the work done before.</para>

<para>Why is all this feel good philosophy here?  Isn't this a 'Welcome to Koha' letter, you ask?  Well, this stuff <emphasis>is</emphasis> part of our welcome.  We're proud of the work that we've done so far.  We're also excited about the improvements and additions that are just over the horizon.  We want you to get comfortable with Koha, to make it your own.  In fact, we want you to be so comfortable with it that you're ready to make changes in it, and we want you to feel at home enough to contribute them back to the community.</para>

<para>We're a friendly bunch, we've got a users mailing list where you should feel free to ask questions.  You can subscribe by filling out the form at http://koha.org/mailing_list.html .  If you'd rather ask questions in real time, you can use irc and meet with us on the #Koha-Support channel at irc.katipo.co.nz, port 6667. </para>

<para>I hope I've convinced you to join the project, but even if I haven't I hope that you'll enjoy the time you spend with our software.</para>

  <para>
  Happy cataloging!

  <sect2 id="To_Start">
	   <title>To Start</title>

   <para>
    The usual pattern for a Koha installation is the setup of a dedicated server in the library to support the installation of a server grade operating system and the necessary support software.  Koha was originally designed to run with Apache running on Linux.  Most sites have continued this trend.    Koha should run with little or no adjustment necessary on most versions of Unix.  Similarly, there are no Apache specific areas in the code, however we have little feedback on how the application will run with other HTTP daemons.  Any feedback is most appreciated.
   </para>
   <!-- <para><emphasis>It is possible to run Koha on Microsoft's Windows server platform with appropriate ports of support tools.  A mail list devoted to windows related koha issues has been started at, please see the FAQ section for more information and the links for downloads. </emphasis></para> -->
   <para>NB: All the Koha system administrators are firm believers in backing up the database on a regular schedule, especially before upgrades to existing Koha installations.</para>

This will permit all of the cgi scripts to be executed as 'user' opac.  The Virtualhost then may suexec to the user installing Koha, and koha.conf can then be written by that user, avoiding the need for the chown command, which is restricted to a superuser.

  <para>The Catalogue search is the first step to identify a particular item or material on a particular subject. It offers the option of an item barcode search (the barcode can be scanned or typed), or single or combined specific searches, which can be customized for individual sites. The Horowhenua Library Trust searches (above) offer Keyword and Title and/or Author and/or Dewey (i.e.class number) and/or Class (i.e. item type), and/or Subject search. Other fields such as Publisher, Abstract, web site etc. are also possible.  Searches can be constructed using more than one field e.g. to find a video of Les Miserables: a search for Title Miserables and Class Video, will bring up a listing for the video, but not the book with the same title. Searching over more than one field will slow the search down.</para>

<para>The title search offers the alternative of an exact title search, (by clicking on the exact button). This is useful for short titles consisting only of very common words eg Time, War</para>

<sect3 id="CatalogRecord">
  <title>Catalogue Record:</title>

<para>The full cataloguing record is stored in three sections: Biblio, Group, and Item records. </para>

<sect4 id="TheBibliosection">
  <title>The Biblio Section</title>
<para> The Biblio section contains the copyright information: author, title, series, copyright date and subject. Several printings of the same work can be attached to one Biblio record - paperback, hard back, large print, e-book.</para>
</sect4>

<sect4 id="TheGroupSection">
  <title>The Group Section</title>

<para>The Group section contains bibliographic data for a particular publication of that work, such as ISBN number, physical description, imprint (publisher information), etc. A Group record can contain one or several items. It also specifies the item type (and associated borrowing parameters), and classification. You might have eg 2 copies of a title, one of which is to be Reference only, and the other a borrowing copy. You would make 2 group records, one for each copy. But if you later added another borrowing copy, you would add it to the group containing the first borrowing copy, since all the data in that Group record is true of both copies.</para>
</sect4>

<sect4 id="TheItemSection">
  <title>The Item Section</title>
<para>Item section contains the information relating to one specific copy: barcode, purchasing information, branch attachment, lending record.</para>

<para>Further catalogue maintenance is available by clicking on the Catalogue maintenance link (in the Help box). (Access to this section may be password protected). The Catalogue maintenance section lets a cataloguer correct some other errors that creep into the catalogue: subject and group maintenance, and retrieving a biblio that has been deleted by mistake.</para>

	<para>After submitting the screen, you reach the same additem.pl? screen as described above.
Section Two covers Group Information and Item information. You are asked first for the Item information: a barcode, the branch to which it is allocated (for multi-branch systems), the replacement price and any notes that apply to this copy only. Only the barcode and branch are mandatory. Then you have the option of adding to an existing group, or of creating a new group to add it to (see description under 1.2 Cataloguing Record.) </para>
<para>Adding a New Group requires you to specify the Format, or item type from a list you will have compiled with your installer. Standard cataloguing fields follow. Dewey subclass is used for filing letters, if you use them.  Volume, Number and Volume Description can be used to identify separate issues of a periodical, for issuing purposes. It is useful to standardize the Volume description -- so use Apr 2002, May 2002, or 2002/04, 2002/05 and stick to your standardized description every time.

<para>
Cataloguing is done from two points of access, but starts always with a catalogue search which identifies whether the title is in the library or not.

After a catalogue search, if there is already a record, clicking on the title will allow to modify or to delete the biblio record in the next step, clicking on the item's barcode number will allow to update the group or item record.

If the title is not yet in the database, a new record must be entered through acquisitions where a record linked to a supplier must be created first. For further detail consult the acquisitions part of the manual.

Keyword search:
On the library's homepage typing one or more words in the Search the catalogue field results in a keyword search on the catalogue.</para>

A keyword search leads to a list of all records that contain the keyword in title, subtitle, series or subject fields. From the list it's possible to look at the detailed information attached to the biblio record: i.e. what kind of items exist, and their whereabouts. From the details, it is possible to place a reservation on an item if you are a member of the library.</para>

Search the catalogue by Title, Author, Keyword or Class (choice from a list). It's possible to search in only one of these options or to make it a combined search, the latter takes longer to be executed.</para>

<para>
In HLT a child needs a guarantor, mostly a parent, to use the library and thus children cannot join on their own account, but only guaranteed by an adult member. This guarantor takes over the responsibility of the books borrowed by the child.</para>

<para>To add a child, i.e. a guarantee, first bring up (or join) the adult, i.e. the guarantor, then click on the Guarantee button at the top of the Membership Record column, and Koha shows the member screen for the guarantee with all the parent's address data copied by the system into the child's data. The child's record asks only for the information which is distinctive for the child.
Up to three children can be registered on the same screen before clicking on Save Change, then Submit to save the record. The number of children registered will now display as links on the guarantor's record, and the users are thus linked.</para>
<para>
A guarantor can only be deleted if all linked guarantees have already been deleted. The guarantee still receives his/her own borrower card and can use the library on its own - but may have other use conditions (e.g. guarantees can borrow less items)</para>

<sect4 id="Renewals">

>From any screen in circulation, the box returns leads to the returns screen.</para>

<!-- *screenshot circ-10-ret1* -->

<para>Return books in the system by reading or entering the barcode number. You can read in an unlimited number of books to return them one after the other. The system will show the last item returned with information on overdue dates or payments involved. Also, the last ten items returned are shown. </para>

<para>If a book is reserved, a window pops up to ask confirmation of the reservation. A click on yes prints the reserve slip. In case that there are any overdue charges, the date on the returned items list will show up in red and the overdue charges will show up beside the book. They can be "paid" in the system immediately if wished. Note that the change displayed is the total amount owing, not just the charge for this one book.</para>

If a item hasn't been issued, a special message will indicate this<para>

<sect4 id="Payment of fees">
        <title>Payment of fees</title>

<para>
Fine regimes are set up by parameters.</para>
<para>If an item can cause a fee to be charged to a member, the system keeps track of these fees. They can be left unpaid, marked off as paid or written off (should be used only according to the library policy).</para>

<para>Looking up and treating fees of a certain member is possible from the circulation and the members section of koha. The first is the direct way when a member card is used, the latter when the name is to be searched. In practice, fee payments occur most often during circulation, the access through issues is thus shown here. For the options from the members section, see above under Member - Fines.</para>

<!-- *screenshot circ-7* -->

<para>To access payment options click on the Payment link in the Patron Information box.</para>


<!-- *screenshot circ-6-pay* -->

<para>Any fee paid must be checked off as such. To signal a paid fee, check the box Paid.</para>

<para>Depending on the parameters set for each user category, a certain amount of unpaid fees can result in blocking the member for any further borrowing. As long as the member hasn't paid up, the system doesn't allow borrowing any more items and will tell you so.</para>

<!-- *screenshot* -->

<para>Manual invoices and credit notes can be entered by clicking on the buttons so marked. Note that the amount entered does not required a $ or any other currency symbol. Any amount can be booked in, independent of the actual fees due. If a borrower's account goes into credit, the sum owing will show up as a negative sum.</para>

<!-- *screenshot* -->

<para>In Koha, there exists an elegant way of dealing with lost (= very overdue) books. The borrower is charged with the cost of the book, which effectively blocks further borrowing. The book's status is changed to Lost (very overdue), and the item is removed from OPAC displays, but remains on the intranet displays. If the book is returned later, the value of the book is credited to the borrower, and only the fine remains. So, if the borrower says that he or she can't find the book and pays for it, and if they eventually find it, they still can get their money back. And all is accounted for in Koha.</para>

<sect4 id="Reserves">

<para>
At installation, Koha comes with a set of default values for the parameters. Each library will edit these values according to their need. In order to prepare a first configuration and to give a general idea of which parameters can take what values, a description of the parameters follows. This list is not exhaustive and will undergo some changes with each new release. Right now it must be considered, even for the actual releases, as "very much under construction" yet.</para>

<para>The actual editing of the parameters is done from the Koha admin page. Clicking on the link of any parameter leads to its admin page, where it is possible to add a new category to a parameter, to edit existing ones or to delete an outdated one.</para>

<para>The values of systempreferences influence which features Koha is going to support. It is the section of parameters which each library should take care of first. The default values are listed below as well as their options.</para

If you're deeply interested, ask the collective mind of the developer list, and they'll fill you in on the current status of the discussion. </emphasis></para>
 <para>Subroutines should NOT open and close the database every time. The DBI handle (usually $dbh) should be passed as a parameter from the main script running.

 </sect2>
 <sect2 id="Unit_Testing">
  <title>Unit Testing</title>
<para><emphasis>What is unit testing?</emphasis></para>
<para>Unit testing is a method for verifying that you software does what it is supposed to. The idea is that you have a testing framework (Test::Harness in our case) that will automatically run your tests for you, reporting any failures. You'll then write a series of tests to exercise every function of every module in your program. Instead of boring you with details, let's start with an example.  For the Koha project, it is a key part of our effort to have production grade, reliable code.</para>

<para><emphasis>How do I do it?</emphasis></para>
<para>I'll start with the Koha.pm module. It contains four functions: </para>
<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>slashifyDate</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>fixEthnicity</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>borrowercategories</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>ethnicitycategories</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></para>
<para>All of our tests should go into the t/ directory, and should be put into a file showing which module we're testing. In this case, we'll create a file t/koha.t to hold our tests. Tests start with a bit of magic to make them work:</para>

<para><programlisting role="perl">
BEGIN { $| = 1; print "1..1\n"; }
END {print "not ok 1\n" unless $loaded;}
use C4::Koha;
$loaded = 1;
print "ok 1\n";
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>This sets up the test, tells the harness that it will be running one test (the 'print "1..1\n"' bit), and ensures that the test can load the module (that would be the first test).</para>

<para>If we run the test now, we'll get:</para>
<para><screen>
[pate@gnupate t]$ perl koha.t
1..1
ok 1
[pate@gnupate t]$
</screen></para>
<para>or:</para>
<para><screen>
[pate@gnupate koha]$ ./testKoha.pl
t/koha..............ok
All tests successful.
Files=1, Tests=1, 1 wallclock secs ( 0.25 cusr + 0.11 csys = 0.36 CPU)
[pate@gnupate koha]$
</screen></para>
<para>
slashifyDate takes a string representing a (MySQL style) date,
replaces '-'s with '/'s and returns it in European style date. We can
test it like this:
</para>
<para><screen>
$date = "02/01/2002";
$newdate = &amp;slashifyDate("2002-01-02");

if ($date eq $newdate) {
print "ok 2\n";
} else {
print "not ok 2\n";
}
</screen></para>
<para>We'll also need to let the harness know that we've added a test, so let's change the first line to look like this:</para>

<para><screen>
BEGIN { $| = 1; print "1..2\n"; }
</screen></para>

<para>Now, running the tests looks like this:</para>
<para><screen>
[pate@gnupate koha]$ ./testKoha.pl
t/koha..............ok
All tests successful.
Files=1, Tests=2, 1 wallclock secs ( 0.23 cusr + 0.09 csys = 0.32 CPU)
[pate@gnupate koha]$
</screen></para>
<para>Then, we can go on and add tests until we end up with something like:</para>
<para><screen>
[pate@gnupate koha]$ ./testKoha.pl
t/format............ok
t/koha..............ok
t/output............ok
t/require...........ok
All tests successful.
Files=4, Tests=40, 1 wallclock secs ( 1.25 cusr + 0.11 csys = 1.36 CPU)
</screen></para>

<para><emphasis>What needs to be tested?</emphasis></para>
<para>You don't need to test everything, just the things that can fail.</para>

<para>Ok, so maybe this is overkill. But we really should (and try to) test aggresively. Not only should we write tests for expected input, but also for fringe cases that should produce failures.</para>

<para>Additionally, anytime we fix a bug, we should try to represent it in one (or more) unit tests. That way we can feel comfortable that no one accidentally reintroduces the bug later on.</para>

<para><emphasis>Who writes the tests?</emphasis></para>
<para>We do. In fact, it is best if the programmer who sits down to write new code would do well to write some tests first. This way, he (or she) will know they got the code right. It's a tremendously liberating way to write code.</para>


<para><emphasis>When do I run the tests?</emphasis></para>
<para>Please, run the tests every time you're ready to check code in! Then fix any errors before you check in. Right now, the tests all pass on the rel_1_2 branch. Let's keep it that way ;)</para>

<sect2 id="Templating">
<Title>Themes and Templating</Title>
<para> The koha project uses the terms themes and templating to refer to a set of functions that permit easy porting of koha to other languages and customization of the appearance of Koha's front end.

<para><emphasis>How does it work?</emphasis></para>
<para>Every page served up by koha comes from two files: </para>
<para> * A perl script that makes database searchs and handles requests etc. The script loads a template and defines some template-parameters that are displayed in the template.</para>
<para> * A template that provides the HTML design. Data generated by the script is substituted into the template where you enter special template-parameter tags. </para>
<para>Koha uses templates to handle internationalization and appearance customization.</para></para>

<para><emphasis>About Templates</emphasis></para>
<para>Templates are principally a means of separating presentation and style from the data. This simplifies the data processing code while providing enhanced opportunities to customise the look and feel of the interface. Koha uses HTML::Template to export information from the underlying perl scripts. This information is combined with code contained in the template themselves. This results in the display of an apparently normal web page.</para>

<para>Template files are composed of mostly standard HTML code which is viewed by the end user via a standard Web browser. The template file also contain some special HTML-like tags which allow information passd from the perl scrips to appear as if they were embedded in the HTML template document itself. This is a similar principle (but not the same) employed by Koha Server Side Includes (SSI).</para>

<para><emphasis>How to use it?</emphasis></para>
The systempreferences table in the database holds the settings that control how Koha chooses templates.

<para>To configure themes (currently) you have to set a variable</para>

<para>At present there are two places for settings:  the koha.conf file (/etc/koha.conf), and the systempreferences table in the database.</para>

<para>In the systempreferences table, there is a block of options responsible for theme/template issues:</para>
<para><screen>
Name=opacthemes
Value=theme1 theme2 theme3 ...
</screen></para>
<para><empahsis>Note: You have to specify at least one theme.<emphasis></para>

<para><emphasis>Go try it out!</emphasis></para>
So you can play around with the various settings, and look at some of the templates that have already been contributed, we have set up koha specially for you.
opac-templates.koha.org &lt;http://opac-templates.koha.org> is the publically accessible part of koha. You can access the user pages using the login.....
intranet-templates.koha.org &lt;http://intranet-templates.koha.org> is the librarians access into koha. In particular you can navigate through the "parameters" page to system preferences to try setting the themes and languages.

<para><emphasis>Can I Contribute My Templates?</emphasis></para>
Of course. We welcome contributions from simple bug fixes to full multi-language theme suites!
Templates can be uploaded into and edited on test koha sites mentioned above using the Kea content management system. You will need to register and learn a little about how to use kea. However it is very easy :-)
Please read the instructions &lt;contribute.html> on how to register and access content mangement system. Also we have collect some documents on how it all works and style/code guidelines etc.

<para><emphasis>So.....</emphasis></para>
<para>Currently, to make a template to make koha available in a particular language, you need to do a CVS checkout of the latest source, and copy /koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/default/en into /koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/default/XX, where XX is the two letter abbreviation appropriate for the language you are translating to (for help with getting an appropriate code, email the developer list).  After that you can simply translate strings within the files.  You also need to take care of the image URLs, as most templates make use of our "old" images, which live in SERVERROOT/images.  Those specific to your language template should be placed in SERVERROOT/default/XX/images (only for your default theme, of course).  Imagines specific to a theme (ie, a different look and feel for koha, not a language template) shoudl be in SERVERROOT/default/all/images.  You may wish to substitute the default/XX bit with &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME = "themelang">. </para>
You also need to to add "opaclanguages / XX en" and "opacthemes / default" into the systempreferences file.  If added, koha will use the translated templates when the exist, and the english one otherwise. If you don't do this, Koha will only the english templates.</para>
<para>If you're interested in creating just a new look-and-feel configuration for Koha, please get in touch!</para.

<para>As the above is a fairly complicated list of things to do and keep track of, efforts are underway to use a tool provided by Katipo called Kea (a brief introduction to which is included in the appendices) for more user-friendly templating access.</para>

<para><emphasis>If You're 'Theming', Please Remember:</emphasis></para>

<para> * All templates should live in koha-tmpl, along with there associated includes and images (style sheets, javascripts, etc)</para>

<para> * The associated cvs branch will eventually replace the koha-html tree all together.</para>

<para> * Under koha-tmpl there are two subtrees: intranet-tmpl/ and opac-tmpl/, which correspond to what should go into the &lt;serverroot>/intranet/htdocs/ and &lt;serverroot>/opac/htdocs/ directories on the live sites.</para>

<para> * Under each of these are /&lt;theme>/&lt;lang>/ directories. Each theme can have different language settings. At present I have been working only on
the /default/en/ templates.</para>

<para> * To do theme, language selection: In the scripts there should be the lines:</para>
<para><screen>
use C4::Output;
my $template = gettemplate("opac-search.tmpl", "opac");

The gettemplate subroutine looks for the theme and language settings,
looks for a template, loads the template and sets the &lt;themelang> tag for
use in all the includes etc. I.e.

src="&lt;TMPL_VAR NAME='themelang'>/images/search-button.gif"

<sect2 id="MARC">
<Title>MARC Information</Title>
<para>In the 1.3/2.0 releases of Koha, the exciting new function is marc compliance.  As koha is an international project, every marc flavour is supported <emphasis>(at least, that's what we hope...)</emphasis> and as some users don't want to see marc in their ILS, the old-db style is supported as well.  Thus, an important work is to define the parameters tables for the marc you want to manage.  As this function is still being tested and ajdusted, documentation is currently available at http://www.saas.nsw.edu.au/wiki/index.php?page=UserDoc which covers the various parameters, and more technical information about the plugin is available at http://www.saas.nsw.edu.au/wiki/index.php?page=PlugInDoc .</para>

<varlistentry><term><emphasis>Where did Koha come from?</emphasis></term>
<listitem>
<para>
The name comes from the Maori word for a gift or donation. The programme was written by Katipo Communications for the Horowhenua Library Trust, in response to a need for a library programme that would run at branch libraries connected to the central library by ordinary phone lines. See http://www.library.org.nz/koha.htm (Or Appendix 2) for the full story.

<varlistentry><term><emphasis>Who is this Kaitiaki person?</emphasis></term>
<listitem>
<para>
Kaitiaki is the Maori word for Guardian.  When the Koha user and developer community realized some sort of combination Benevolent Dictator/Juggler might be a good idea, they chose a name that would reflect what they felt his/her role would be.  The Kaitiaki is currently elected from among the membership of the developer's list -- this includes the Katipo staff as well as representatives of several of the libraries and the far flung contributors of code, documentation, and kibitzing.  This person is also responsible, with the advice and consent of the community, for trying to decide target dates for things like releases and features scheduling... and trying to help bring some order from the chaos ;). He also helps coordinate efforts and agendas, particularly through the mechanism of the every-few-weeks IRC meetings. Traditionally, the Kaitiaki also handles things like release announcements to sites like OSS4lib.

It's a small district on the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand, wedged between the Tararua mountains and the Tasman Sea. It's about an hour's drive north of the city of Wellington, and has population of 30,000. The name means erosion or landslide in Maori.

<para>
For vowel sounds, think French: a as in far; e as in egg; i as the
e in me; o as the a in paw; u as the oo in moon, dipthong ai as y in sky

For consonants, wh is pronounced variously as h, w and f; we use the
f pronunciation in Horowhenua. Other consonants as you would expect, with
the p a little softer and less explosive than in English.
The stress is always on the first syllable, with a secondary stress
on the third syllable in Horowhenua. So:
   <para>koha (kaw_ha)</para>
   <para>horowhenua (haw_raw_fen_oo_a)</para>
   <para>katipo (kah_tee_paw)</para>
   <para>kaitiaki (ky tee a kee)</para>
*If you are serving a community where Spanish is spoken, you may want to use a different name to refer to the software. The reason for this is that the Maori word "Koha" (gift) sounds like the Spanish word "coja" (cripple).

<varlistentry><term><emphasis>How scalable is Koha?/(as in) How big a library system can it support?</emphasis></term>
<listitem>
<para>
Good question. :)
The Koha developers think this is most likely a database(ie MySql) issue, primarily. Big server, lots of RAM is better for heavier use.  It comes down to what an acceptable number of seconds is for any given lookup to complete. Our guess is that it would be most important for circulation side of things. Librarians generally don't want to wait for more than a second to complete a return, for example. This would require some benchmarking with real data. The next question would provide a rough guideline, although we're pretty confident that Koha could be scaled to libraries larger than CMSD and HTL. To date, no speed complaints have been received.

[The following is a comment from Simon Blake (simon AT katipo.co.nz) on the subject]</para>
<para> Were I specifying a new box for Koha, given current prices I'd put as much RAM as I could into the machine - 1.5Gb of RAM costs (I assume) around US$100-150 at the moment, and with that much RAM in the box, most of the Koha database will be in memory rather than on disk, and this does brilliant things for the performance of MySQL. So, lots of RAM is crucial, and then as much CPU and disk performance as you can afford.  Bear in mind that Koha will work fine on a low spec machine (say, a Pentium 150 with 32Mb RAM), it'll just be slow, and the slowness will increase as usage increases. So you can run it on almost any machine that can run MySQL and Apache, and see how it goes, and if it's too slow then you can throw money at the problem until you get the performance you want.  You'll need to tune MySQL to use all that RAM, here's what Chris has in the MySQL config at the moment:</para><para>
<screen>
set-variable   = key_buffer=256M
set-variable   = max_allowed_packet=1M
set-variable   = table_cache=256
set-variable   = sort_buffer=1M
set-variable   = record_buffer=1M
set-variable   = myisam_sort_buffer_size=64M
set-variable   = thread_cache=8
</screen>
</para><para>
Make sure, also, that your disks are setup correctly, with the highest possible DMA support - hdparm is your friend. I'd observe, also, that long term Koha should get faster, and thus need less in the way of resources to run it - there are some fairly inefficient table structures in Koha, a hangover from the previous system HLT ran, and as these get ironed out and removed, I'd expect Koha to get quicker.

<para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term><emphasis>Can you give a brief explanation of koha/opac/site-search differences for a non-librarian?</emphasis></term>
<listitem>
<para>
KOHA : This is the name for the "product" the library system as a whole.
The same as say "ExLibris" or "BookPlus".
There are two main access points into Koha, the Librarians "view" which we talk about as "The Intranet" and the Publics "view" which we talk about as "The Opac". Opac seems to be a fairly meaningful library term which stands for "Online Public Access Catalogue".  Because all of the functionality of Koha is delivered via a web-browser those seemed to be terms that made sense to us.  I'm not sure where you got "site search" from in the context of Koha (there isn't one as part of koha). Usually that's a term used for a search engine that indexes and searches the parts of a libraries website that *are not* the catalogue. So basically it searches the parts of a library website that are the library hours, membership information, supplementary info about the collections etc etc.  On our sites (library and non library) we use htdig as a generic site search.
Koha does not by default have a generic library site "attached" to it, although there is no reason why you couldn't add more HTML pages to it if you wanted to.
I'm not sure what work is duplicated in the various products (koha vs. opac) and what's unique in each.
The Intranet and The OPAC are two sides of the same coin - the OPAC has more limited information displayed, because we assume you wouldn't want the public/members able to edit library information etc, and that they wouldn't want to see as much of the information held about a book (like the 3 or 4 "prices" for example).

<listitem>
<para>
Library cards employ check digits. Check digits are numbers that are based on a mathematical formula devised to help detect typical data entry errors.
Koha library cards employ a 9 character number, the first character is an alpha code, and the last "number" may be an X - Let's refer to the card number as (ALPHA)ABCDEFG(1..9 or X). </para>
<para>To calculate the check digit:</para>
<para>Calculate= (4xA) + (6xB) + (3xC) + (5xD) + (2xE) + F G is the remainder when divided by 11. If the remainder is 10, then use  "X".</para>

<para>The standard for Koha is a barcode standard. The library would get a batch of barcodes from the printer with checkdigits included. Here is an excel spreadsheet to generate koha compatible card numbers http://developer.koha.org/HLT2.xls</para>

<para>Brief history of cardnumbers and koha:</para>
<para>Horowhenua Libraries get their cards with a barcode and a number on them. The number conforms to the checkdigit routine. So Koha didn't need to generate cardnumbers. It just needed to check that the number entered conformed to the checkdigit routine.</para>

<para>
Nope.  We at Koha are sorely lacking that. What you need in the systempreferences table is to use the simple acquisitions module.  That is: </para>
<para>Insert into systempreferences (variable,value) the values ('acquisitions','simple'); Then, from the index page of the intranet page (eg your equivalent of http://hlt.katipo.co.nz/ ) clicking on acquisitions will take you to the simple acqui screen and you should be able to start loading in data from there.</para>

<title>Appendix B: An Interview on Koha</title>

<para>Welcome to the worlds first Free Open Source Library System. Made in New Zealand by the Horowhenua Library Trust and Katipo Communications Ltd theKoha system is a full catalogue, opac, circulation and acquisitions system. </para>

<para>The Koha story so far......</para>

<para>Koha : Free Library Software</para>

<para>by Rosalie Blake, Head of Libraries, Horowhenua Library Trust, Levin and Rachel Hamilton-Williams, General Manager and Webmistress, Katipo Communications, Wellington.</para>

<para><emphasis>Rosalie:</emphasis>
The first thing I remember learning about computers, back in the early eighties, was "Never buy the hardware and then try to make the software fit". This worthy precept was followed fairly quickly by "Never buy programme that someone promises to write for you".</para>

<para>Why then, in 1999, the year that INCIS hit the headlines, and with the memory of NDIS still lingering, was I contemplating a course of action that defied both precepts?</para>

<para>I found myself in 1999 with a system we'd had and loved for 12 years. It was simple to operate and ran fast at our branch libraries over an ordinary dial up modem. But it was looking tired, and we suspected our networking system wasn't going to stand the challenge of 2000.</para>

<para>I started the time-honoured procedure of searching for a new system. As I read through the 25cm high pile of paper that resulted from a (very selective) RFP, I got more and more depressed. It wasn't just that the new offerings were expensive to purchase, the real killer was in the running costs. The support charges were a steep increase, but added to that was huge 500% increase in telecommunication costs every year, stretching relentlessly into the future. That pretty Windows interface was going to be hideously expensive to implement.</para>

<para>Now, along with every other red-blooded kiwi, I resent sacrificing a huge chunk of my hard-won budget to a telco. What to do? 1-1-2000 was approaching much too fast for comfort.</para>

<para><emphasis>Rachel</emphasis>
Katipo have worked with the Library for many years, training staff and supporting the network. We watched the RFP process with interest - read it and thought "you could do this using the Internet, and that would at least take care of the telco costs". We'd already done an OPAC for Wellington City Library and lots of database work, and somewhat naively thought "How hard can it be?"</para>

<para>So we got together a plan: as long as the library could tell us how library worked, we could do the rest. As it turned out, figuring out how a library worked really was the hard bit. </para>

<para>Our Mission was to have a new system running in the library for the first day of business in 2000. The requirements: At the branches it should issue and return at least at the same speed as the incumbent system, It should run on the libraries existing equipment, a motley collection of 486 and pentium hardware, It must still be nice and easy for the public and librarians to use. </para>

<para>With the lofty goals in place it was time for the hard grind. It would have two interfaces - a web browser for most of the system, but a simple fast Telnet interface for issues and returns. We quickly choose the systems we would use, free and fast all the way. Linux server OS, MySQL database, Perl programming for the web and telnet interfaces - hmm all we were missing was a report writer, but one would turn up.</para>

<para>What followed was 16 weeks of incredibly close work with the library. Drop dead dates came and went - amazingly without us dropping dead. </para>

<para><emphasis>Rosalie:</emphasis>
The new system started to take shape, and it looked good. When you change to a new system it has to look good - people are more sympathetic to something that looks nice, and there are all those members of the public to win over. </para>

<para>What colour should the screens be? And what shall we call it? Hard experience teaches you never to let a committee near decisions like these.But we were wedded to democratic processes, and we finally found solutions everyone could live with. The colours were a compromise, and the name chosen was Koha. Why Koha? Because it's free. Because it's our gift.</para>

<para><emphasis>Rachel:</emphasis>
We recommended to the library that they release the software as "OpenSource". That means that anyone else can download the software and run itup on their machine without paying either us or Horowhenua Library Trust a cent. </para>

<para>I can see the colour draining from your faces from here. Really a free system? But why? </para>

<para><emphasis>Rosalie:</emphasis>
Not just for the glory (though this is a world first)! </para>

<para>Katipo convinced us this was a good idea for several reasons. One was to give the library some surety. Katipo is a small business, and it's important that the library be future-proofed against anything happening to that company. Another was because neither the Library Trust nor Katipo saw themselves as in the business of marketing and supporting a new library system. With an open-source system, that's not a problem. Word of mouth markets it, and the users support each other. The more libraries and programmers using and working on a system, the better it becomes.</para>

<para><emphasis>Rachel:</emphasis>
We tested on the librarians who were fantastic, coming in over the holidays to throw us the curve balls. We had Christmas day off, and then started installing in the library. The last days on the old system were between Christmas and New Year. On the third of January 2000 Koha met the public, for real, for the first time.  </para>

<para>By lunch time we still hadn't switched back to the old system. The OPACs were in use, and issues and returns, while a bit flakey, were happening. Neither the librarians nor the patrons had stormed out in protest. We'd done it! </para>

<para>Since then the pace has eased a little, and we've fine-tuned and even rewritten some of the code that went by as a blur before Christmas. We won two awards for Koha in September 2000 - the 3M Award for Innovation in Libraries 2000 and the ANZ Interactive Award, Community/Not for Profit category 2000. </para>

<para>We have big plans for stage two. That's when the online features for members get added in, and some sexier bits to make the library staff's lives easier.</para>

<para><emphasis>Both of us:</emphasis>
We'd like to see other libraries take it on. If you're a small to medium-sized library, with or without satellite sites, or a mobile library (yes you could run this from a laptop and cell phone!) Koha could be just what you're looking for. But don't just take our word for it. Have a look. www.koha.org </para><para>

<para><emphasis>BEFORE STARTING</emphasis></para>
<para>To create a new language template, you need to contact one of the following people, who will arrange for an area for your language to be created in the Kea system.  </para>

<para><emphasis>System Requirements</emphasis></para>
<para>Minimum Requirements are:</para>
<para>A Computer Connected to the Internet,</para>
<para>Internet Explorer 5.0 or newer or a Mozilla browser such as Netscape 6,</para>
<para>- NB: Kea is affected on the speed of your internet connection and to a smaller degree by the power of your machine. A faster internet connection will make Kea easier to use.</para>

<para><emphasis>Things You Need To Ask Someone Else To Do</emphasis></para>
<para>Restore pages from backup,</para>
<para>Roll back a website to a previous state, </para>
<para>Undelete files marked for deletion.</para>

<para><emphasis>Logging Into The Kea File Manager</emphasis></para>
<para>In order to login to File Manager you will need 3 things:</para>
<para>Your Kea user name,</para>
<para>Your Kea password,</para>
<para>The URL of the File Manager on the edit site.</para>

<para><emphasis>Differences Between The File Manager And Edit Content</emphasis></para>

<para>The File Manager is the tool where you preform actions on files such as finding files to edit, or preview, deleting moving and triggering files. In order to edit a page, you will first need to find it in the File Manager.</para>
<para>Edit Content: Once you have found the file you wish to edit in the file manager, click on "Edit Content" to launch the content editor. You make your changes in the yellow box and then Submit them to the page, click "Ok" to stay on that page, or "Exit" to return to the file manager.</para>


<para><emphasis>Navigating In File Manager</emphasis></para>
<para>To Navigate around our edit site in File Manager, it is best to think of the File Manager Screen in 3 sections.</para>
<para>Breadcrumbs: Breadcrumbs show you the path to where you are now, and enable you to retrace your steps. The first element in the path is the home or root folder for the website. All the names in this path are links, click on any name in the breadcrumbs to jump back to that folder.</para>
<para>Folders: This is a listing of all the folders within the folder you are currently in. If you click on the name of a folder, you will be taken to the File Manager screen for that folder. Clicking on subfolders is how you go forward in a site. You can only move forward one folder at a time (just the same as in the Windows File Manager - -Explorer).</para>
<para>File Listing: This is a listing of all the files in the current folder. If you click on the file name, you will get a preview of the page.</para>

<para><emphasis>The File Manager Screen Explained</emphasis></para>
<para>Below is an example of a File Manager Screen for a user with full privileges. Note that some of the Screen options are not availble to all users.

<para>1. You Are Here: These are "breadcrumbs", showing the path through the folders you have taken. They show which folder you are working in at the moment. You can use these for navigation. Click on any of the links in the breadcrumbs to take you back to that folder.</para>
<para>2. Checked Out Files: This is a listing of all the files that are Checked Out to you. Once you have finished working on a file, make sure that it has been released so that others can work on it. To release the file so that others may edit it, click the file name next to "Checked Out Files".</para>
<para>3. Create Folder: Used to make a new folder with the name given in the field next to it. Only letters, hyphens,underscores, full stops and numbers are acceptable characters in the folder name. Spaces are unacceptable. We strongly recommend you use lower case letters in your file and folder names.</para>
<para>4. Folders: Listing of sub folders below the current folder. Use these for navigation. Click on a folder name to access the files in that folder.</para>
<para>5. Upload File: Use this to locate the file you wish to upload locally from your own drive. Clicking Browse will bring up a window from which you can select your file. Click Ok to select the file you want and the name will appear in the field to the left of the browse button. Click Upload to copy the file into the current folder. Note: Files over 1Mb will not be uploaded.</para>
<para>6. Create New File: Used to Create A New Page on the Website (you probably will not need this feature, as you should only be changing copies of the existing files).</para>
<para>7. Check Boxes: Click a box to select a file so you can trigger/notify, move or delete it. Click multiple boxes to preform the same action on multiple files at once (again, not something you should need for a translation). </para>
<para>8. Edit Content: Clicking on the Edit Content link will launch the Kea Editor on this page. </para>
<para>9. Filename: Click on the file name to preview the page.</para>
<para>10. Column Headings: Click on a Column heading to reorder the files.</para>
<para>11. Edit Info: This page contains information about the page such as the page title (appears in the status bar of the browser and breadcrumbs) meta data used by search engines to search your page, who "owns" the page , and when it was published.</para>
<para>12. Edit Source: Opens up the source editor. Only enabled for the webmaster or people with advanced HTML skills.</para>
<para>13. Last Modified: Shows when page was last modified.</para>
<para>14. Modified By: Gives the username of the last person, usually an email address to edit this page. Clicking the username will bring up a history of all the users who have edited this page. </para>
<para>15. Trigger: Copies the page across to the live site. This option is only available to site administrators or those with Trigger privileges.</para>
<para>16. Delete: Deletes the page from the File Manager listing. Note that all deleted files go into a "Trash Can" that is normally deleted weekly. If you have deleted a file by accident contact your website administrator to get the file reinstated. </para>
<para>17. Notify: Appears in place of the Trigger button for most users. This option will send an email to your site administrator, notifying them that changes have been made and requesting that they trigger the page live.</para>
<para>18. Move: Moves the selected file to another folder within the site. Note that it pays to check files after they have been moved to fix links etc. Move also allows users to rename a file. (Again, not something you should need for Koha work.)</para>
<para>19. Select All: Selects all the files in the folder.</para>

<para><emphasis>Launching The Kea Content Editor</emphasis></para>
<para>Log on to File Manager</para>
<para>Use the folder listings and breadcrumbs to locate the folder in which your page resides.</para>
<para>Once you are in the correct folder, click the folder name eg index.html, to preview the page in your web browser. Check that this is the correct page that you want to edit. Use the browser back button to go from the preview back to the File Manager screen.</para>
<para>In File Manager, click "Edit Content" to the right of the file name you wish to edit.</para>
<para>You will be taken to a view of the page where the editable text is highlighted yellow. Note that there may also be some text highlighted purple, changes to this text may appear on other pages. </para>

<para><emphasis>Making Changes</emphasis></para>
<para>Clicking on an area of yellow highlighted text, will open up the Kea window. It is in the Kea window that you edit a block of text.</para>
<para>Different parts of the page are separated into kea blocks. For example, the page heading is normally in a different Kea block to the main body text.</para>
<para>You can now change the text as you would do normally in Word. Try adding some text. eg "Adding some text".</para>
<para>Kea will recognise line breaks (carriage returns) and paragraph breaks. Hit enter once for a line break. Hit enter twice for a paragraph. Note: Kea will only recognise one paragraph break at a time. If you try to enter several paragraph breaks between paragraphs, kea will ignore all but the first one.</para>
<para>To commit your changes to the page, press Submit.</para>
<para>The Kea box will close and be replaced by a smaller one as per below:</para>
<para>To continue editing the page press Ok, to exit the Kea editor and return to the File Manager screen click exit.  We want to continue editing the page so click Ok.</para>
<para>You should now be able to see the change you have made to the page. Click the text you have just changed again to open the Kea window.</para>
<para>Now we are going to look at the other buttons on the Kea window.</para>
<para>In the top right corner of the kea window there are 3 buttons. The horizontal line (-) minimises the kea window. The question mark (?) opens the Kea help pages (Note this function is currently disabled). The cross closes (X) the Kea window. You will loose any changes you have made. In the bottom left of the screen there is the Submit button we used before to commit changes and the Cancel button. Make a change to the page and then press Cancel. You will get a little box that comes up "Loose Changes". Click OK. Your changes will be lost and the Kea window closed.</para>
