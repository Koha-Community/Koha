#Any                  1016  The record is selected if there
#                           exists a Use attribute that the
#                           target supports (and considers
#                           appropriate - see note 1) such
#                           that the record would be
#                           selected if the target were to
#                           substitute that attribute.
#       Notes:
#        (1) When the origin uses 'any' the intent is that the target
#            locate records via commonly used access points. The target
#            may define 'any' to refer to a selected set of Use
#            attributes corresponding to its commonly used access points.
#        (2) In set terminology: when Any is the Use attribute, the set
#            of records selected is the union of the sets of records
#            selected by each of the (appropriate) Use attributes that
#            the target supports.
Any 1=1016
kw Any

#Anywhere             1035  The record is selected if the
#                           term value (as qualified by the
#                           other attributes) occurs anywhere
#                           in the record.
#
#            Note: A target might choose to support 'Anywhere' only in
#            combination with specific (non-Use) attributes. For example, a
#            target might support 'Anywhere' only in combination with the
#            Relation attribute 'AlwaysMatches' (see below), to locate all
#            records in a database.
#
#       Notes on relationship of Any and Anywhere:
#        (1) A target may support Any but not Anywhere, or vice versa, or
#            both.  However, if a target supports both, then it should
#            exclude 'Anywhere' from the list of Use attributes
#            corresponding to 'Any' (if it does not do so, then the set
#            of records located by 'Any' will be a superset of those
#            located by 'Anywhere').
#        (2) A distinction between the two attributes may be informally
#            expressed as follows: 'anywhere' might result in more
#            expensive searching than 'any'; if the target (and origin)
#            support both 'any' and 'anywhere', if the origin uses 'Any'
#            (rather than 'Anywhere') it is asking the target to locate
#            the term only if it can do so relatively inexpensively.

#Server-choice        1017  The target substitutes one or

#                           leaves the choice to the target.
#
#
#       Notes on relationship of Any and Server-choice:
#        (1) When the origin uses 'Server-choice' it is asking the target
#            to select one or more access points, and to use its best
#            judgment in making that selection.  When 'Any' is used,
#            there is no selection process involved; the target is to
#            apply all of the (appropriate) supported Use attributes.
#            The origin is asking the target to make a choice of access
#            points.
#        (2) The target might support 'Any' and not 'Server-choice', or
#            vice versa, or both.  If the target supports both, when the
#            origin uses 'Server-choice', the target might choose 'Any';
#            however, it might choose any other Use attribute.
