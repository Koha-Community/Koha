Interface with this dependency subsystem using $ENV{KOHA_PATH}/koha_debian_packages.pl


Add files to this directory to define the debian packages we need specific to our Koha-Suomi version.
Files starting with . are excluded.

eg:

installer/KohaSuomi/Packages/
                             libmodern-perl-perl
                             libjson-xs-perl
                             nano
                             curl
                             .README

This would trigger our Ansible build scripts to make sure the packages

libmodern-perl-perl
libjson-xs-perl
nano
curl

are installed on KohaSuomi version upgrade.

| WHY DO WE NEED THIS SUCKY DIRECTORY ? |
 +-------------------------------------+

... and not use a single file to list the dependencies into?

A: Because that would cause Git conflicts when two separate commits add new package dependencies.
   Then somebody would have to fix those merge conflicts all the time.
   I don't want to repeat the mistake of the old installer/data/updatedatabase.pl -script where everybody
   was going crazy because they had to rebase their git conflicts all the time.
   This was because: always adding new DB changes to the end of the file, leading to every commit with DB changes
   to be automatically unmergeable if one commit with DB changes was pushed while the patch was in the making.
   And waiting a long time in the "Need sign-off"-queue would just exarberate this issue.
