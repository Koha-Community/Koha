# Fix some bugs :
# * worked in 1.9.0, but not in 1.9.1 :
# - modif of a biblio didn't work
# - empty fields where not shown when modifying a biblio. empty fields managed by the library (ie in tab 0->9 in MARC parameter table) MUST be entered, even if not presented.
#
# * did not work before :
# - repeatable subfields now works correctly. Enter 2 subfields separated by | and they will be splitted during saving.
# - dropped the last subfield of the MARC form :-(
#
# Internal changes :
# - MARCmodbiblio now works by deleting and recreating the biblio. It's not perf optimized, but MARC is a "do_something_impossible_to_trace" standard, so, it's the best solution. not a problem for me, as biblio are rarely modified.
# Note the MARCdelbiblio has been rewritted to enable deletion of a biblio WITHOUT deleting items.

# Support for 000 -> 010 fields.
# Those fields doesn't have subfields.
# In koha, we will use a specific "trick" : fields <10 will have a "virtual" subfield : "@".
# Note it's only virtual : when rebuilding the MARC::Record, the koha API handle correctly "@" subfields => the resulting MARC record has a 00x field without subfield.

# Revision 1.35  2003/02/03 18:46:00  acli
# Minor factoring in C4/Biblio.pm, plus change to export the per-tag
# 'mandatory' property to a per-subfield 'tag_mandatory' template parameter,
# so that addbiblio.tmpl can distinguish between mandatory subfields in a
# mandatory tag and mandatory subfields in an optional tag
#
# Not-minor factoring in acqui.simple/addbiblio.pl to make the if-else blocks
# smaller, and to add some POD; need further testing for this
#
# Added function to check if a MARC subfield name is "koha-internal" (instead
# of checking it for 'lib' and 'tag' everywhere); temporarily added to Koha.pm
#
# Use above function in acqui.simple/additem.pl and search.marc/search.pl

#
# Revision 1.5  2002/07/24 16:11:37  tipaul
# Now, the API...
# Database.pm and Output.pm are almost not modified (var test...)
#
# Biblio.pm is almost completly rewritten.
#
# WHAT DOES IT ??? ==> END of Hitchcock suspens
#
# 1st, it does... nothing...
# Every old API should be there. So if MARC-stuff is not done, the behaviour is EXACTLY the same (if there is no added bug, of course). So, if you use normal acquisition, you won't find anything new neither on screen or old-DB tables ...
#
# All old-API functions have been cloned. for example, the "newbiblio" sub, now has become :
# * a "newbiblio" sub, with the same parameters. It just call a sub named OLDnewbiblio
# * a "OLDnewbiblio" sub, which is a copy/paste of the previous newbiblio sub. Then, when you want to add the MARC-DB stuff, you can modify the newbiblio sub without modifying the OLDnewbiblio one. If we correct a bug in 1.2 in newbiblio, we can do the same in main branch by correcting OLDnewbiblio.
# * The MARC stuff is usually done through a sub named MARCxxx where xxx is the same as OLDxxx. For example, newbiblio calls MARCnewbiblio. the MARCxxx subs use a MARC::Record as parameter.
# The last thing to solve was to manage biblios through real MARC import : they must populate the old-db, but must populate the MARC-DB too, without loosing information (if we go from MARC::Record to old-data then back to MARC::Record, we loose A LOT OF ROWS). To do this, there are subs beginning by "NEWxxx" : they manage datas with MARC::Record datas. they call OLDxxx sub too (to populate old-DB), but MARCxxx subs too, with a complete MARC::Record ;-)
#
# In Biblio.pm, there are some subs that permits to build a old-style record from a MARC::Record, and the opposite. There is also a sub finding a MARC-bibid from a old-biblionumber and the opposite too.
# Note we have decided with steve that a old-biblio <=> a MARC-Biblio.

=head1 NAME

C4::Biblio - acquisition, catalog  management functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

move from 1.2 to 1.4 version :
1.2 and previous version uses a specific API to manage biblios. This API uses old-DB style parameters.
In the 1.4 version, we want to do 2 differents things :
 - keep populating the old-DB, that has a LOT less datas than MARC
 - populate the MARC-DB
To populate the DBs we have 2 differents sources :
 - the standard acquisition system (through book sellers), that does'nt use MARC data
 - the MARC acquisition system, that uses MARC data.

Thus, we have 2 differents cases :
- with the standard acquisition system, we have non MARC data and want to populate old-DB and MARC-DB, knowing it's an incomplete MARC-record
- with the MARC acquisition system, we have MARC datas, and want to loose nothing in MARC-DB. So, we can't store datas in old-DB, then copy in MARC-DB. we MUST have an API for true MARC data, that populate MARC-DB then old-DB

That's why we need 4 subs :
all I<subs beginning by MARC> manage only MARC tables. They manage MARC-DB with MARC::Record parameters
all I<subs beginning by OLD> manage only OLD-DB tables. They manage old-DB with old-DB parameters
all I<subs beginning by NEW> manage both OLD-DB and MARC tables. They use MARC::Record as parameters. it's the API that MUST be used in MARC acquisition system
all I<subs beginning by seomething else> are the old-style API. They use old-DB as parameter, then call internally the OLD and MARC subs.

- NEW and old-style API should be used in koha to manage biblio
- MARCsubs are divided in 2 parts :
* some of them manage MARC parameters. They are heavily used in koha.
* some of them manage MARC biblio : they are mostly used by NEW and old-style subs.
- OLD are used internally only

all subs requires/use $dbh as 1st parameter.

I<NEWxxx related subs>

all subs requires/use $dbh as 1st parameter.
those subs are used by the MARC-compliant version of koha : marc import, or marc management.

I<OLDxxx related subs>

all subs requires/use $dbh as 1st parameter.
those subs are used by the MARC-compliant version of koha : marc import, or marc management.

They all are the exact copy of 1.0/1.2 version of the sub without the OLD.
The OLDxxx is called by the original xxx sub.
the 1.4 xxx sub also builds MARC::Record an calls the MARCxxx

WARNING : there is 1 difference between initialxxx and OLDxxx :
the db header $dbh is always passed as parameter to avoid over-DB connexion

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=over 4

=item @tagslib = &MARCgettagslib($dbh,1|0);

last param is 1 for liblibrarian and 0 for libopac
returns a hash with tag/subfield meaning
=item ($tagfield,$tagsubfield) = &MARCfind_marc_from_kohafield($dbh,$kohafield);

finds MARC tag and subfield for a given kohafield
kohafield is "table.field" where table= biblio|biblioitems|items, and field a field of the previous table

=item $biblionumber = &MARCfind_oldbiblionumber_from_MARCbibid($dbh,$MARCbibi);

finds a old-db biblio number for a given MARCbibid number

=item $bibid = &MARCfind_MARCbibid_from_oldbiblionumber($dbh,$oldbiblionumber);

finds a MARC bibid from a old-db biblionumber

=item $MARCRecord = &MARCkoha2marcBiblio($dbh,$biblionumber,biblioitemnumber);

MARCkoha2marcBiblio is a wrapper between old-DB and MARC-DB. It returns a MARC::Record builded with old-DB biblio/biblioitem

=item $MARCRecord = &MARCkoha2marcItem($dbh,$biblionumber,itemnumber);

MARCkoha2marcItem is a wrapper between old-DB and MARC-DB. It returns a MARC::Record builded with old-DB item

=item $MARCRecord = &MARCkoha2marcSubtitle($dbh,$biblionumber,$subtitle);

MARCkoha2marcSubtitle is a wrapper between old-DB and MARC-DB. It returns a MARC::Record builded with old-DB subtitle

=item $olddb = &MARCmarc2koha($dbh,$MARCRecord);

builds a hash with old-db datas from a MARC::Record

=item &MARCaddbiblio($dbh,$MARC::Record,$biblionumber);

creates a biblio (in the MARC tables only). $biblionumber is the old-db biblionumber of the biblio

=item &MARCaddsubfield($dbh,$bibid,$tagid,$indicator,$tagorder,$subfieldcode,$subfieldorder,$subfieldvalue);

adds a subfield in a biblio (in the MARC tables only).

=item $MARCRecord = &MARCgetbiblio($dbh,$bibid);

Returns a MARC::Record for the biblio $bibid.

=item &MARCmodbiblio($dbh,$bibid,$record,$delete);

MARCmodbiblio changes a biblio for a biblio,MARC::Record passed as parameter
if $delete == 1, every field/subfield not found is deleted in the biblio
otherwise, only data passed to MARCmodbiblio is managed.
thus, you can change only a small part of a biblio (like an item, or a subtitle, or a additionalauthor...)

=item ($subfieldid,$subfieldvalue) = &MARCmodsubfield($dbh,$subfieldid,$subfieldvalue);

MARCmodsubfield changes the value of a given subfield

=item $subfieldid = &MARCfindsubfield($dbh,$bibid,$tag,$subfieldcode,$subfieldorder,$subfieldvalue);

MARCfindsubfield returns a subfield number given a bibid/tag/subfieldvalue values.
Returns -1 if more than 1 answer

=item $subfieldid = &MARCfindsubfieldid($dbh,$bibid,$tag,$tagorder,$subfield,$subfieldorder);

MARCfindsubfieldid find a subfieldid for a bibid/tag/tagorder/subfield/subfieldorder

=item &MARCdelsubfield($dbh,$bibid,$tag,$tagorder,$subfield,$subfieldorder);

MARCdelsubfield delete a subfield for a bibid/tag/tagorder/subfield/subfieldorder

=item &MARCdelbiblio($dbh,$bibid);

MARCdelbiblio delete biblio $bibid

=item &MARCkoha2marcOnefield

used by MARCkoha2marc and should not be useful elsewhere

=item &MARCmarc2kohaOnefield

used by MARCmarc2koha and should not be useful elsewhere

=item MARCaddword

used to manage MARC_word table and should not be useful elsewhere

=item MARCdelword

used to manage MARC_word table and should not be useful elsewhere

Update a biblio record.

C<$biblio> is a reference-to-hash whose keys are the fields in the
biblio table in the Koha database. All fields must be present, not
just the ones you wish to change.

C<&modbiblio> updates the record defined by
