<h1>Members help</h1>
<p>This is the Members portion of Koha.</p>
<p>The Members portion stores the information you add about your patrons.</p>
<p>To add a patron, type their name into the search box on the left, and
click the OK button.</p>
<p>If there is already a borrower matching the name you searched, it will show
after you click OK. This can be particularly useful when people have lost
their cards or when children forget their cards. That way, you can avoid having
multiple numbers for the same patron.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can browse a section of borrowers by selecting the first
letter of the Patron's last name from the list on the right.</p>
