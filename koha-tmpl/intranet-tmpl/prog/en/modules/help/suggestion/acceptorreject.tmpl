<h1>Suggestions Management</h1>

<h2>What are Purchase Suggestions?</h2>
<p>Purchase suggestions give the users of the OPAC a way to lodge requests for the library to purchase for items.</p>
<p>To use this feature, purchase suggestions need to be turned on in system preferences. (System Preferences &gt; OPAC Features &gt; Suggest set to &quot;on&quot;).</p>

<h2>How do I manage suggestions?</h2>
<p>Suggestions that have been placed but not acted upon will show on the &quot;Waiting&quot; tab below. To process a suggestion the &quot;Status&quot; needs to be changed and a &quot;Reason&quot; chosen.</p>
<p>Marking an item as &quot;Accepted&quot;, will move the suggestion to the Accepted tab. The suggested item can now be added to an order in Acquisitions by using the &quot;From a Suggestion&quot; feature under &quot;Add To Order&quot;.</p>
<p>Marking an item  as &quot;Rejected&quot;, will move the selected item to the rejected tab.</p>
<p>When ever the status is changed to Accepted or Rejected, the reason for the status change can be selected from the &quot;Reason&quot; drop down. Reasons are AuthoriZed values that need to be setup by the library. There is also the option to select &quot;Other&quot; and enter a custom reason.</p>
<p>The authorized values for &quot;Reason&quot; can be set under System Administration &gt; Authorized Values. From the drop down select the &quot;SUGGEST&quot; authorized value category and add your custom reasons.</p>
<p>Once the status and reason have been selected, these will display for the suggestor in the OPAC.</p><!-- TMPL_INCLUDE NAME="help-bottom.inc" -->
