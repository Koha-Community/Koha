<h1>Merge authorities</h1>

<p>From this screen you can choose to merge two authority records.</p>

<p>First you will be asked which of the two records you would like to keep as your primary record and which will be deleted after the merge.</p>

<p>You will be presented with the MARC for both of the records (each accessible by tabs labeled with the authority numbers for those records). By default the entire first record will be selected, uncheck the fields you don't want in the final (destination) record and then move on to the second tab to choose which fields should be in the final (destination) record.</p>

<p>Once you have completed your selections click the 'merge' button. The primary record will now contain the data you chose for it and the second record will be deleted.</p>
