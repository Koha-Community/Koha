<h1>Reports</h1>

<p>Koha's reporting module allows you to gather data from your system.  There are two main types of reports:

<ul>
	<li>Custom Reports
<ul>
	<li>Koha's data is stored in a MySQL database which means that librarians can generate nearly any report they would like by either using the Guided Reports Wizard or writing their own SQL query.</li>
    <li><a href="http://schema.koha-community.org/" target="blank">Koha database schema:</a> shows the entire Koha database structure so that you can write effective SQL Queries</li>
    <li><a href="http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/SQL_Reports_Library" target="blank">Koha reports library:</a> lists reports written by Koha users around the world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Statistical Reports
<ul>
	<li>Statistic reports will show you counts and sums. These reports are all about numbers and statistics, for reports that return more detailed data, use the Guided Report Wizard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
