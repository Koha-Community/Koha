<h1>Receiving Orders Help</h1>

<h2>How do I receive items that have arrived?</h2>
<p>Firstly, check the catalog details that you are recieiving the right item. If these are correct, you can add the  item details.</p>
<p>For each item you will need to check the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Volume/Copy </strong>for Serials</li>
		<li><strong>Item Barcode</strong> scan or enter the barcode that has been assigned to the item</li>
		<li><strong>Home Library </strong>choose the home library/branch for the item from the drop down list</li>
		<li><strong>Item Type </strong>choose the item type from the drop down.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>How do I receive multiple identical items?</h2>
<p>If you have ordered multiple copies of the same item, then use the &quot;+&quot; to bring up another <strong>Item Details</strong> input fieldset.</p>
<p>For each copy you will need to set that Item Barcode, Home Library and Item Type.</p>
<p>Each time you add a new item, the <strong>Quantity Received</strong> under <strong>Accounting Details</strong> should be updated.</p>
<p>If you press the &quot;+&quot; by mistake, use the &quot;-&quot; button to remove the unwanted Item Details <strong>input fieldset </strong></p>
