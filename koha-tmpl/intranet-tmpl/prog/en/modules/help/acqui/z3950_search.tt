<h1>Order from an External Source</h1>

<p>If you want to search other libraries for an item to purchase, use the 'From an external source' option, which will allow you to order from a MARC record found via a Z39.50 search.</p>

<ul>
    <li>From the results, click the Order link next to the item you want to purchase.</li>
    <li>If the item you're ordering from an external source looks like it might be a duplicate, Koha will warn you and give you options for how to proceed.
<ul>
    <li>From the warning, you can choose to order another copy on the existing bib record, create a new bib record, or cancel your order of this item.</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>In the order form that pops up, you will not be able to edit the catalog details</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>See the full documentation for Ordering in the <a href="http://koha-community.org/manual/[% helpVersion %]/en/html/acquisitions.html#create-a-basket">manual</a> (online).</strong></p>
