<h1>Acquisitions Help</h1>

<h2>What is Acquisitions?</h2>
<p>The Koha Acquisitions module provides a way where the library can record orders placed with vendors and manage purchase budgets.</p>
<p>You do not need to use Acquisitions to add items to your catalog. If you do not want to track orders and budget expenditure, then use the <strong>&quot;Add MARC&quot; </strong>feature in <strong>Cataloging </strong>to add new bibliographic and item records.</p>

<h2>How to place an order?</h2>

<p>To place an order, the first step is to locate your Vendor (supplier). If no Vendor exists, you will need to create one. Once you have a Vendor you can place an order.</p><h2>What needs to be setup to use Acquisitions?</h2>
<p>To make the most of acquisitions the following needs to be setup under <strong>System Administration</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Budgets and Funds</strong> - &quot;Funds&quot; are used to group &quot;Budgets&quot;. For example a Fund may be called &quot;General Stack&quot;, and will have a &quot;Budget&quot; which records the amount availalbe to spend during the period of the budget. A budget must have a start and end date.</li>
		<li><strong>Exchange Rates (optional)- </strong>If making purchases in overseas currency, the exchange rate will need to be set realtive to your local currency. Remember that your local currency should be set to 1.00<br/><strong>NOTE: Exchanges Rates need to be updated manually.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Vendor(s) - </strong>These are the entities where items are purchased, or donated from. Orders are placed with Vendors.</li>
