<h1>Receiving Orders</h1>

<p>Orders can be received from the vendor information page or the vendor search results page.</p>

<p>After clicking 'Receive shipment,' you will be asked to enter a vendor invoice number and a shipment received date.</p>

<p>The Receive Page will list all items still on order with the vendor regardless of the basket the item is from.</p>

<p>To receive a specific item, click the 'Receive' link to the right of the item.</p>

<p>From this form, you can alter the cost information. You can also choose to only receive one of multiple items if only one arrived. Once you have made any necessary changes, click 'Save' to mark the item as received.</p>

<p>When you're finished receiving items, you can navigate away from this page or click the 'Finish receiving' button at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>You will also see that the item is received if you view the basket.</p>
