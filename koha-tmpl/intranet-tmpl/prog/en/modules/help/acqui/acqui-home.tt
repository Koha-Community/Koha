<h1>Acquisitions</h1>

<p>The Koha Acquisitions module provides a way for the library to record orders placed with vendors and manage purchase budgets.</p>

<p>You do not need to use Acquisitions to add items to your catalog. Acquisitions is used only to track vendors and spending against your budgets.</p>

<p>Before using the Acquisitions Module, you will want to make sure that you have completed all of the set up.</p>

<p>First, set your Acquisitions System Preferences and Acquisitions Administration to match your library's workflow.</p>

<p><strong>See the full documentation for Acquisitions in the <a href="http://koha-community.org/manual/[% helpVersion %]/en/html/acquisitions.html">manual</a> (online).</strong></p>
