<h1>Quote of the day editor</h1>

<p>The Quote of the Day (QOTD) editor allows for editing of and adding to the pool of quotes which serve as the source of the Quote-Of-The-Day (QOTD) feature in OPAC.</p>

<p>There are four basic functions in the editor:</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Editing</b></li>
    <ol>
        <li>Once the current quote pool has been loaded into the editing table, you may edit the quote source and text.</li>
        <li>Edit either the 'Source' or 'Text' fields by clicking on the desired field.</li>
        <li>When you are finished editing a field, press the &lt;Enter&gt; key to save the changes.</li>
        <li>The list will be updated, the edits saved, and visible.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><b>Add Quote</b></li>
    <ol>
        <li>This option allows for the addition of quotes one at a time.</li>
        <li>Click the 'Add quote' button in the toolbar and an empty quote entry will be added to the end of the current quote list.</li>
        <li><b>Note: </b>Both the 'Source' and the 'Text' fields must be filled in in order to save the new quote.</li>
        <li>When finished filling in both fields, press the &lt;Enter&gt; key to save the new quote.</li>
        <li>The list will update and the new quote should now be visible.</li>
        <li>You may cancel the addition of a new quote any time prior to saving it simply by pressing the &lt;Esc&gt; key.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><b>Delete Quote(s)</b></li>
    <ol>
        <li>This option allows for the deletion of one or more quotes at a time.</li>
        <li>Select the quote(s) you desire to delete by clicking on the corresponding quote id.</li>
        <li>Once quote selection is finished, simply click the 'Delete quote(s)' key.</li>
        <li>You will be prompted to confirm the deletion.</li>
        <li>After confirming the deletion, the list will update and the quote(s) will no longer appear.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><b>Import Quotes</b></li>
    <ol>
        <li>This option allows for the uploading of a CSV file containing bulk quotes.</li>
        <li>Detailed help for this option is available on the QOTD uploader page.</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
