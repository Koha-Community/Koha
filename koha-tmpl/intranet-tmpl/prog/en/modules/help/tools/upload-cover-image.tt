<h1>Upload cover images</h1>

<p>This tool will allow you to upload cover images for the materials in your catalog. To access this tool, staff will need the upload_local_cover_images permission. In order for images to show in the staff client and/or OPAC you will need to set your LocalCoverImages and/or OPACLocalCoverImages preferences to 'Display.' Images can be uploaded in batches or one by one.</p>

<p>If uploading a single image:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Visit the tool and click the 'Browse' button to browse to the image on your local machine.</li>
    <li>Click 'Upload file'</li>
    <li>Choose 'Image file' under the 'File type' section</li>
    <li>Enter the biblionumber for the record you're attaching this image to. This is not the same as the barcode, this is the system generated number assigned by Koha.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Find the biblionumber by looking at the end of the URL in the address bar when on the detail page or by clicking on the MARC tab on the detail page in the staff client</li>
</ul>
    <li>If you would like to replace any other cover images you may have uploaded in the past, check the 'Replace existing covers' box under the 'Options' section</li>
    <li>Click 'Process images'</li>
    <li>You will be presented with a summary of the upload and a link to the record you have just added the image to</li>
</ul>

<p>If uploading a batch of images at once you will need to prepare a ZIP file first.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Enter in to the ZIP file all the images you are uploading</li>
    <li>Also include a text file (*.TXT) named either datalink.txt or idlink.txt listing the biblionumber followed by the image name for each image one per line
<ul>
    <li>ex. 4091,image4091.jpg</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>Browse your local computer to the ZIP file</li>
    <li>Click 'Upload file'</li>
    <li>Choose 'Zip file' under the 'File type' section</li>
    <li>If you would like to replace any other cover images you may have uploaded in the past, check the 'Replace existing covers' box under the 'Options' section</li>
    <li>Click 'Process images'</li>
    <li>You will be presented with a summary of the upload</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be able to see your cover images in the staff client on the detail page under the 'Image' tab in the holdings table at the bottom</p>

<p>In the OPAC the cover images will also appear in the images tab, as well as next to the title and on the search results.</p>
