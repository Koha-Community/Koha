<h1>Task scheduler</h1>

<p>The task scheduler is a way to schedule reports to run whenever you want.</p>

<p>To schedule a task, visit the Task Scheduler and fill in the form</p>

<ul>
	<li>Current Server Time shows the time on your server (schedule all of your reports to run based on that time - not on your local time)</li>
	<li>Time should be entered as hh:mm (2 digit hour, 2 digit minute)</li>
	<li>Date should be entered using the calendar pop up</li>
	<li>From Report choose the report you want to schedule</li>
	<li>Choose whether to receive the text of or a link to the results</li>
	<li>In the Email filed enter the email of the person you want to receive your report</li>
</ul>

<p>Below the task scheduler form, there is a list of scheduled reports</p>

<p>You can also schedule reports directly from the list of saved reports by clicking the 'Schedule' link</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>Task scheduler will not work if the user the web server runs as doesn't have the permission to use it. To find out if the right user has the permissions necessary, check /etc/at.allow to see what users are in it. If you don't have that file, check etc/at.deny. If at.deny exists but is blank, then every user can use it. Talk to your system admin about adding the user to the right place to make the task scheduler work.</p>
