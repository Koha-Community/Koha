<h1>	   
	   Upload Patron Images</h1><p>This tool allows you to upload multiple patron images as a batch.</p>
	   
	   <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Requires that the 'patronimages' system preference is set to 'ON' to use this feature.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><em>Get there: </em>More &gt; Administration &gt; Global System Preferences &gt; Patrons &gt; patronimages</li>
		</ul><h2>Upload images in bulk</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Go to the 'Tools' module (usually under 'More' in your Global Nav)</li>
			<li>Choose 'Upload patron images'</li>
			<li>You can choose to upload images in bulk by making a zip file with the images and a text file entitled &quot;DATALINK.TXT&quot; or &quot;IDLINK.TXT&quot;</li>
			<li>For each group of pictures that has the cardnumber of the patron and the file containing that patrons picture. One patron per line separated by either commas or tabs.<br/>
			<ul>
				<li>			   
			   IMPORTANT: Make sure that your TXT file is a plain text document, not RTF.</li>
				<li>			   
			   
			    <span>
IMPORTANT: Make sure that you use either a comma or a tab to separate IDs from image names</span></li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Add the images and the TXT file to a .ZIP file</li>
			<li>Browse for the file from the Koha interface</li>
			<li>Click 'Unpack' and you will receive a confirmation screen</li>
			<li>To see the image(s) you imported search for the patron(s) and view their profile</li>
			<li>If you'd like to change the image, just upload a new image</li>
			<li>If you'd like to delete the patron image, click the 'Delete' button under 'Manage Patron Image'</li>
		</ul>	   
	   <p><strong>Uploading Single Images</strong>
If you only have one patron image you might want to upload it via the patron information page instead of using this bulk tool.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Go to the Patrons menu at the top of the staff client</li>
			<li>Search for the patron you have the image for</li>
			<li>If there is more than one result, click on the name of the patron you'd like to add an image to</li>
			<li>Scroll down to the image upload form</li>
			<li>Browse for the image on your computer and click 'Upload'</li>
			<li>If you'd like to change the image, just upload a new image</li>
			<li>If you'd like to delete the patron image, click the 'Delete' button under 'Manage Patron Image'</li>
		</ul><h3>Why can't I upload patron images?</h3>
<p>First you will need
	    <span class="ex">
a patronimages/</span>directory.  If you do not have this directory you will see an error.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Contact your system administrator to create this directory and you'll be set to go.</li>
			</ul>
<h3>What size should my images be?</h3>
<p>There is a limit of 100K on the size of the picture uploaded and it is recommended that the image be 120x200 pixels, but smaller images will work as well.</p>
<h3>What image formats are supported?</h3>
<p>Only PNG, GIF, JPEG, XPM formats are supported.</p>
