<h1>Batch Patron Modification</h1>

<p>With this tool you can make edits to a batch of patron records. Simply load in a file of cardnumbers (one per line) or scan patron card numbers in to the box provided.</p>

<p>Once you have the file loaded or the barcodes scanned click 'Continue.' You will be presented with a list of the patrons and the changes you can make.</p>

<p>To the left of each text box there is a checkbox. Clicking that checkbox will clear our the field values.</p>

<p style="color:#990000;">Important: If the field is mandatory you will not be able to clear the value in it.</p>

<p>If you have multiple patron attributes you can change them all by using the plus (+) sign to the right of the text box. This will allow you to add another attribute value.</p>

<p>Once you have made the changes you want, you can click 'Save' and Koha will present you with the changed patron records.</p>
