	<li>Below the summary is the option to import the batch of bib records using a specific framework

</ul>
</li>
	<li>Below the framework selection there will be a list of the records that will be imported
<ul>
	<li>Review your summary before completing your import to make sure that your matching rule worked and that the records appear as you expect them to</li>
