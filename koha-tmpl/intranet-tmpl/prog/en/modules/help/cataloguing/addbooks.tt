<h1>Cataloging</h1>

<p>Before you start cataloging in Koha you're going to want to do some basic setup. Refer to the Implementation Checklist for a full list of these things. Most importantly you're going to want to make sure that your Frameworks are all defined the way you want. Once in the cataloging module you will not be able to add or remove fields and subfields so your frameworks must be ready before you start cataloging.</p>

<p>From here you can add new bibliographic records to Koha.</p>

<p>Records can be added to Koha via original or copy cataloging. If you would like to catalog a record using a blank template</p>

<ul>
    <li>Click 'New Record'</li>
    <li>Choose the framework you would like to base your record off of</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to catalog a record based on an existing record at another library</p>

<ul>
    <li>Click 'New from Z39.50/SRU' (optionally, you can choose a framework to which import the record by clicking the caret on the right).</li>
    <li>Search for the item you would like to catalog</li>
    <li>Tip: If no results are found, try searching for fewer fields, not all Z39.50/SRU targets can search all of the fields above.</li>
    <li>Search targets can be altered by using the Z39.50/SRU Admin area.</li>
    <li>From the results you can view the MARC or Card view for the records or choose to Import them into Koha
<ul>
    <li>In addition to the Import link to the right of each title, you can click on the title you're interested in and a menu will pop up with links to preview the record and import it</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>If you don't find the title you need in your Z39.50/SRU search results you can click the 'Try Another Search' button at the bottom left of your results</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you've opened a blank framework or imported a record via Z39.50/SRU you will be presented with the form to continue cataloging</p>
