<h1>Merging items</h1>

<p>To merge bibliographic records together you will want to go to the Cataloging module and perform a search.</p>

<p>If you see duplicates on that search results screen you can check the boxes next to the duplicates and click the 'Merge selected' button at the top of the results. If you choose more than or fewer than 2, you will be presented with an error.</p>

<p>Once you have selected the records you want to merge, click the 'Merge selected' button at the top of the list. You will be asked which of the two records you would like to keep as your primary record and which will be deleted after the merge. If the records were created using different frameworks, Koha will also ask you what Framework you would like the newly merged record to use.</p>

<p>You will be presented with the MARC for both of the records (each accessible by tabs labeled with the bib numbers for those records). By default the entire first record will be selected, uncheck the fields you don't want in the final (destination) record and then move on to the second tab to choose which fields should be in the final (destination) record.</p>

<p>Should you try to add a field that is not repeatable two times (like choosing the 245 field from both record #1 and #2) you will be presented with an error.</p>

<p>Once you have completed your selections click the 'merge' button. The primary record will now CONTAIN the data you chose for it as well as all of the items/holdings from both bib records, and the second record will be deleted.</p>
Important

<p>It is important to rebuild your zebra index immediately after merging records. If a search is performed for a record which has been deleted Koha will present the patrons with an error in the OPAC.</p>

<p>Note: If you would like you can also use the Lists tool for merging records together.</p>
