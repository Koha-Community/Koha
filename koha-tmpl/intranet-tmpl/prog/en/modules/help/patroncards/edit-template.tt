<h1>Templates</h1>

<p>A template is the label/card stock you are using. This might be Avery 5160 for address labels, Gaylord 47-284 for spine labels or Avery 28371 for your patron cards, just to give a couple of examples. These labels will include all of the information you will need for setting up a Koha, this information may be on the packaging, and if not it can usually be found on the vendor's website.</p>

<h2>Add a Template</h2>

<p>To add a new template, you want to click on the 'Templates' button at the top of your page and choose 'New Template'</p>

<p>Using the form that appears you can define the template for your sheet of labels or cards.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Template ID will be automatically generated after saving your template, this is simply a system generated unique id</li>
	<li>Template Code should be something you can use to identify your template on a list of templates</li>
	<li>You can use the Template Description to add additional information about the template</li>
	<li>The Units pull down is used to define what measurement scale you're going to be using for the template. This should probably match the unit of measurement used on the template description provided by the product vendor.</li>
	<li>The measurements can be found on the vendor product packaging or website.</li>
	<li>A profile is a set of "adjustments" applied to a given template just prior to printing which compensates for anomalies unique and peculiar to a given printer (to which the profile is assigned).
<ul>
	<li>Before picking a profile try printing some sample cards so that you can easily define a profile that is right for your printer/template combination.</li>
	<li>After finding any anomalies in the printed document, create a profile and assign it to the template.
After saving, your templates will appear on the 'Manage Templates' page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
