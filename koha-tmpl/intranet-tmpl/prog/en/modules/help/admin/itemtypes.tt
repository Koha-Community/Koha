<h1>Item Types</h1>

<p>Koha allows you to organize your collection by item types and collection codes.</p>

<p>Item types typically refer to the material type (book, cd, dvd, etc), but can be used in any way that works for your library.</p>

<h2>Adding Item Types</h2>

<p>To add a new item type, simply click the 'New Item Type' button at the top of the Item Types page.</p>

<ul>
   <li>In the 'Item Type' field, enter a short code for your item type</li>
	<li>The description is the plain text definition of the item type</li>
	<li>You can choose to have an image associated with your item type
<ul>
	<li>You can choose from a series of image collections</li>
	<li>You can link to a remote image</li>
	<li>Or you can just have no image associated with the item type</li>
	<li style="color: #990000;">Important: To have your item type images appear in the OPAC you need to set noItemTypeImages to 'Show'
<ul>
 <li>Get there: More &gt; Administration &gt; Global System Preferences &gt; Admin</li>
</ul>
</li>

	<li>This will charge the patron on checkout</li>
</ul>
