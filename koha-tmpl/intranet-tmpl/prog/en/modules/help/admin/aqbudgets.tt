<h1>Funds</h1>

<p>Budgets are broken into funds.</p>

<h2>Add a Fund</h2>

<p>A fund is added to a budget.</p>

<p style="color: #990000;">Important: A budget must be defined before a fund can be created.</p>

<p>To add a new fund click the New button and then choose which Budget you would like to add the fund to.</p>

<p>In the form that appears you wan to enter the basics about your fund.</p>

<p>The three first fields are required, the rest are optional</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fund Code is a unique identifier for your fund</li>
	<li>The Fund Name should be something that librarians will understand</li>
	<li>Amount should be entered with only numbers and decimals, no other characters</li>
	<li>You can choose to assign this fund to a librarian. Doing so will make it so that only that librarian can make changes to the Fund</li>
	<li>Choose which library will be using this fund</li>
	<li>You can restrict who can order from this fund by choosing either the owner or the library from the 'Restrict access to' menu</li>
	<li>Notes are simply for any descriptive notes you might want to add so that librarians know when to use this fund</li>
	<li>Planning categories are used for statistical purposes. To learn more about planning categories, check out the Planning Category FAQ.</li>
</ul>

<p>When complete, click 'Submit' and you will be brought to a list of all of the funds for the budget.</p>

<p>To the right of each fund you will find the 'Edit,' 'Delete,' and 'Add Child Fund' options. A child fund simply a sub-fund of the fund listed. An example would be to have a fund for 'Fiction' and under that have a fund for 'New Releases' and a fund for 'Science Fiction.' It is an optional way to further organize your finances.</p>
