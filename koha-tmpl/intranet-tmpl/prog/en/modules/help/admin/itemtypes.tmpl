<h1>Item types management</h1> <p>You can define as many item types as you want.</p>  <p>The item types are the &quot;categories&quot; into which your library items fall. For instance, you probably want to have videocassettes in a different category from non-fiction books, and mysteries in a different category from children's picture books. If you already are using a commercial ILS, you almost certainly already have all of your materials divided up into such categories. Now you need to tell Koha what your categories are.</p>  <p>The itemtype code is limited to four characters. This code is rarely displayed by Koha; instead the description of the type will be what users see.</p>  <p>&quot;Rental charge&quot; is any amount you might charge to users for borrowing items of a certain type (like videos).</p>  <p>&quot;Renewals allowed&quot; indicates how many times an items of this type may be renewed.</p>  <p>Item types are useful for many things, and <strong>very</strong> important in controlling how Koha works :</p> <ul>     <li>Patrons can search on item types</li>     <li>Issuing rules are set for item types (and for patron types / libraries)</li> </ul> <p>Setting up item types is one of the first things you should do after installing the Koha software.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Adding &amp; Editing New Item Types</h3><ul><li>Your system will come with some predefined item types.&nbsp; From this screen you can edit or delete these items</li><li>To add a new item type click 'New Item Type'</li><li>Enter a short code for the 'Item Type'</li><li>Enter a longer explanation in the 'Description'</li><li>Feel free to choose an image for each item type (or selected the 'No image' option)</li><li>The 'Not for loan' option can be used for items that cannot be checked out of the library</li><li>'Renewals' should include the number of times this item can be renewed</li><li>If you charge a rental fee for items (such as DVDs) enter that amount in the 'Rental charge' field</li><li>The summary field is used to edit the way this item displays on the search results page<ul><li><span style="background-color: #ffe599">TIP: For electronic resources you might want to enter </span><span style="background-color: #ffe599"><em>&lt;a href=&quot;[856u]&quot;&gt;open site&lt;/a&gt;</em></span><span style="background-color: #ffe599"> to show the item link on the search results page</span></li></ul></li><li>When you're finished click 'Save Changes'</li></ul><br /><span><br /><strong>Can I have a different type for new releases and older titles?</strong></span><br /><br />Yes.&nbsp; Just enter an item type for new items and assign different circulation rules for this item type.<p>&nbsp;</p>
