<h1>Funds &amp; Budgets</h1>

<p><span style="background-color: #ffe599">TIP: Funds may be ignored if you are setting your Global System Preferences for 'Acquisitions' to &quot;simple&quot; acquisitions: the funds are only useful when using &quot;normal&quot; acquisitions.</span></p>

<p>&quot;Funds&quot; are accounts that you establish to track your expenditures for library materials. They may be used for any kind of material and should match the lines in your materials budget. For instance, if your library establishes a budget line for books, another for audiovisual materials, a third line for magazines, and a fourth budget line for electronic databases, then you would have four funds.</p>
