<h1>Setting Patron Permissions</h1>

<p>Patron permissions are used to define the rights of staff members when in the intranet/staff client.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>To alter patron permissions, click on Patrons on the main menu at the top of the screen.</li>
			<li>Search or browse for the patron you'd like to edit</li>
			<li>Click on the patron's name from the results</li>
			<li>
				Click the 'More' button on the top right of the patron profile and choose 'Set Permissions'
			</li>
			<li>
				Choose the permissions you'd like this patron to have
			</li>
			<li>
				You can pick as many permissions as you'd like for each staff member
			<ul>
				<li>
			    <span style="background-color: #ffe599">
TIP: If a staff member is set to 'superlibrarian' they have access to all functions and do not need any other permissions checked</span></li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>To give staff members more granular permissions, you can turn on the GranularPermissions system preference
			<ul>
				<li><em>Get there:</em> More &gt; Administration &gt; General preferences &gt; Admin &gt; GranularPermissions</li>
				<li>If this setting is on the permissions menu will offer more granual permissions</li>
				<li>This allows staff members access to specific tools
				<ul>
					<li>
				    <span style="background-color: #ffe599">
TIP: If this preference is turned OFF after being ON, the system reverts to the original behavior, although the specific permissions are retained.  This means if a staff member has been given granular permissions they will retain those even if this is turned OFF</span></li>
				</ul></li>
			</ul></li>
