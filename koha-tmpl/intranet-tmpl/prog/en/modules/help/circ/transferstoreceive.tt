<h1>Transfers to receive</h1>

<p>This report will list all of the items that Koha thinks are in transit to your library.</p>

<p>If your transfers are late in arriving at your library you will see a message stating how late your items are.</p>

<p style="color: #990000">Important: An item is considered late based on the number of days you have entered in the TransfersMaxDaysWarning system preference.</p>

<p><strong>See the full documentation for Transfers to Receive in the <a href="http://koha-community.org/manual/[% helpVersion %]/html/circulation.html#transfers-to-receive">manual</a> (online).</strong></p>
