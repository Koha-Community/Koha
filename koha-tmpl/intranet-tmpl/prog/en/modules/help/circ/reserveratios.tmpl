<h1>Hold ratios</h1>

<p>This will show you the number of items you have to order for your library to meet your library's hold per item ratio. By default it will be set to the library needing 3 items per hold that has been placed. The report will tell you how many additional items need to be purchased to meet this quota.</p>
