<h1>Set library</h1>

<p>By default you will enter the staff client as if you are at your home library. This library will appear in the top right of the Staff Client.</p>

<p>This is the library that all circulation transactions will take place at. If you are at another library (or on a bookmobile) you will want to set your library before you start circulating items. To do this you can click 'Set' at the top right or on the Circulation page.</p>

<p>Once you have saved your changes you new library will appear in the top right.</p>

<p><strong>See the full documentation for Setting your Library in the <a href="http://koha-community.org/manual/[% helpVersion %]/en/html/circulation.html#set-library">manual</a> (online).</strong></p>
