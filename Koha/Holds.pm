Koha::Holds - Koha Hold object set class

=head2 Class methods

=head3 filter_by_found

    my $found_holds = $holds->filter_by_found;

Returns a set of holds that are considered I<found>.
Having the code 'P', 'T' or 'W'.

=cut

sub filter_by_found {
    my ($self) = @_;

    return $self->search( { found => [ 'P', 'T', 'W' ] } );
}

=head3 waiting

returns a set of holds that are waiting from an existing set

=cut

sub waiting {
    my ($self) = @_;

    return $self->search( { found => 'W' } );
}

=head3 processing

returns a set of holds that are processing from an existing set

=cut

sub processing {
    my ($self) = @_;

    return $self->search( { found => 'P' } );
}

=head3 unfilled

returns a set of holds that are unfilled from an existing set

=cut

sub unfilled {
    my ($self) = @_;

    return $self->search( { found => undef } );
}

=head3 forced_hold_level

If a patron has multiple holds for a single record,
those holds must be either all record level holds,
or they must all be item level holds.

This method should be used with Hold sets where all
Hold objects share the same patron and record.

This method will return 'item' if the patron has
at least one item level hold. It will return 'record'
if the patron has holds but none are item level,
Finally, if the patron has no holds, it will return
undef which indicates the patron may select either
record or item level holds, barring any other rules
that would prevent one or the other.

=cut

sub forced_hold_level {
    my ($self) = @_;

    my $item_level_count = $self->search( { itemnumber => { '!=' => undef } } )->count();

    my $item_group_level_count = $self->search( { item_group_id => { '!=' => undef } } )->count();
    return 'item_group' if $item_group_level_count > 0;

    my $record_level_count = $self->search( { itemnumber => undef } )->count();

=head3 get_items_that_can_fill

    my $items = $holds->get_items_that_can_fill();

Return the list of items that can fill the hold set.

Items that are not:

  in transit

  lost
  widthdrawn
  not for loan
  not on loan
