===== Installation Instructions =====

This document was prepared in order to help you discover (or test) Koha (Integrated Library System).

The installation of Linux system described below is a basic, it is not designed for a production server (e.g., security, load balancing ... are not described).

This document describes the different stages of installing the software Koha 3 on the openSUSE 11 Linux distribution 
in a "new" computer, that is, a computer that will have its hard disk contents COMPLETELY ERASED to install openSUSE and Koha!

In this example, it's assumed that your server gets an IP address by DHCP that will be later changed to 192.168.0.2. 

You'll have to change this to the real IP address that your machine should get (or use DHCP, if that's the case).

This tutorial assumes a Koha installation that does NOT use Zebra ("Zebra is a high-performance, general-purpose structured text indexing and retrieval engine" - http://www.indexdata.dk/zebra/). Additional steps would be required to set up Zebra for Koha.

==== LINUX System Installation ====


Download openSUSE 11 DVD at: 
http://software.opensuse.org/

Place the DVD in the drive and restart the machine.


After the "Welcome" screen, you'll get a First menu, with the following options:

----
Boot from Hard Disk 

Installation

Repair Installed System

Rescue System

Firmware Test 

Memory Test
----

Choose "Installation" (second command)


=== "Initializing" screen ===

(Dialog box appears saying "Probing Mouse")


=== "Welcome" screen ===

You'll see two Dropdown Lists: "Language" and "Keyboard Layout"

This depends of your place and preference, naturally. 
I live in Portugal, so I want a Portuguese Keyboard Layout but I prefer an Operating System in English. 
So I leave the default option selected for "Language" (English (US)) 
and change "Keyboard Layout" to "Portuguese".

Check the "I Agree to the License Terms" checkbox (under the "License Agreement" textbox).

Click the "Next" button.



=== "System Probing" screen ===


[just watch it...]



=== "Installation Mode" screen ===


Leave "New Installation" radio button checked

Click the "Next" button


=== "Initializing" screen ===


[just watch it...]



=== "Clock and Time Zone" screen ===


Again, I live in Portugal, so I select the following options:

"Region" listbox: click on "Europe"

"Time Zone" listbox: click on "Portugal"

"Hardware Clock Set To" dropdown list: I leave "UTC" selected

Click the "Next" button


=== "Desktop Selection" screen ===


You should see four radio buttons: "GNOME", "KDE 4.0", "KDE 3.5" and "Other".

Click on the "Other" radio button.

Three radio buttons should become visible then:

"XFCE Desktop"

"Minimal X Window"

"Minimal Server Selection (Text Mode)"

click on this last "Minimal Server Selection (Text Mode)" radio button.

Click the "Next" button



=== "Suggested Partitioning" screen ===


Partitioning choices are really up to you. In this example, I will create a 9 GB / ("root") partition and a 712 Swap Megs partition.

So, to do this I click on the "Create Partition Setup..." button.

=== "Preparing Hard Disk: Step 1" screen ===


I click on the first radio button:
"1: 1.IDE 10.0 GB,/dev/sda"

I click the "Next" button


=== "Preparing Hard Disk: Step 2" screen ===


I uncheck the "Propose separate Home Partition" checkbox.

I click the "Next" button.

This takes me back to the Suggested Partitioning screen.


=== "Suggested Partitioning" screen ===


In my case, I now have this:

- Create swap partition /dev/sda1 (760.8 MB)

- Create root partition /dev/sda2 (9.2 GB with ext3)

I click the "Next" button.


=== "Create New User" screen ===


I use this screen to create a regular user.

User's full name: Your Full name (e.g: John Smith)

Username: Your preferred username (e.g.: jsmith)

Password:

Confirm Password:

I uncheck the "Use this password for System Administrator" checkbox.

I uncheck the "Automatic Login" checkbox.

I click the "Next" button (you may be "nagged" with a dialog box by the YAST2 installer warning that you selected a password that it considers to be too simple. Click "Yes" to keep the password you chose, or "No" to change it).


=== "Installation Settings" screen ===


Scroll down to the "User Settings" section and click on the "Root Password" link to change the root password.


=== Password for the System Administrator "root" screen ===


Enter your password (in the "Password for root User" text box) and repeat it (in the "Confirm Password" text box).

Click the "Accept" button to return to the "Installation Settings" screen.


=== "Installation Settings" screen ===


Click on the "Software" link


=== "Software Selection and System Tasks" screen ===


Scroll down the listbox (that begins with the "Base Technologies" group) until you find the "Server Functions" group.

In that "Server Functions" group click on the "Web and LAMP Server" checkbox (to check it)

Click on the "OK" button to return to "Installation Settings"



=== "Installation Settings" screen ===


Click on the "Install" button (placed in the same place where usually appear the "Accept" or "Next" button).

You should see a "Confirm Installation" dialog box. Click on the "Install" button of that dialog box.


=== "Preparing Your Hard Disk" screen ===


[just watch it...]


=== "Deploying Installation Images" screen ===


[just watch it... ]



=== "Package Installation" screen ===



[just watch it... or click on the "Details" tab if you want to see what packages are being installed.]


=== "Finishing Basic Installation" screen ===


[just watch it... ]

After some time you'll see a dialog box warning that the system will reboot in 10 seconds.



=== After reboot ===


Leave "Boot from Hard Disk" selected and click ENTER

You'll have to wait a while (or press ESC to see what the operating system is "doing"). After some moments, you'll 
be taken to the "Yast2 - installation @ Linux" screen (a text installer).


=== "Writing the System Configuration" screen ===


[just watch it... ]

After a while you'll see a prompt:
|--------------------
Welcome to openSUSE 11.0 (i586) - Kernel 2.6.25.4-8-default (tty1)

linux-3r10 login:
|--------------------

You may now login with your "root" user.



==== Changing the Hostname and Domain Name ====
 

I want to change my hostname, domain name and switch from DHCP to a Static IP address.

So, the first thing I do, is to run yast (the setup tool) by entering the yast command in the command prompt:
|--------------------
linux-3r10:~ # yast
|--------------------

Yast should appear.

On the listbox of the left hand side select "Network Devices" (press TAB to turn focus on that listbox, and press the down arrow key several times to reach it). Then, on the listbox of the righ hand side, select "Network Settings" (you'll have again to press TAB to turn focus on that listbox, and press the down arrow key several times to reach it).

Press the ENTER key.


=== "Initializing Network Configuration" screen ===


[just watch it...]

=== "Network Settings" screen ===


I want to disable IPv6, so I first go to the "Global Options" section (by pushing the key combination ALT+G to press the "G" letter in Global Options that is highlighted). In the next screen, I push ALT+E to uncheck the "Enable IPv6" checkbox. I'll get a dialog box with a Warning saying that "To apply this change a reboot is needed.". I just press ENTER on that dialog box, but I do NOT reboot (at least not yet). 

Then I press Alt+O to go to the "Overview" (still in "Network Settings"). Then I press ALT+i to "Edit" the information for this Network Card.

=== "Network Card Setup" screen ===


I check the "Statically assigned IP Address" checkbox, and enter the following info for "IP Address", "Subnet Mask" and "Hostname" (you should use the values defined by your network administrator):

IP Address: 192.168.0.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Hostname: myhost

Then I press ALT+N to click the "Next" button. After a few seconds, I will be taken again to the "Network Settings" screen.


=== "Network Settings" screen ===


I press ALT+s to go to the "Hostname/DNS" screen.

I check the "Change /etc/resolv.conf manually" checkbox and enter the IP Address of my DNS Server in the "Name Server 1" text box:


Name Server 1: 192.168.0.1

Then I press ALT+u to go to the "Routing" configuration.

=== "Routing" screen ===


In the "Default Gateway" text box, I enter the IP Address of my Default Gateway:

Default Gateway: 192.168.0.1

Then I press ALT+F to Finish



=== "Saving Network Configuration" screen ===


[just watch it...]


After a few seconds, you should be taken back to the "YaST2 Control Center" screen.



==== Enabling access to SSH (Secure Shell) and Apache2 (Web Server) ====

I want to administer remotely this server with a SSH (Secure Shell) client. So, while still in the "YaST2 Control Center, I will enable SSH in the Firewall (running by default). In the listbox of the left hand side, I select "Security and Users" and then, on the listbox of the right side, I select "Firewall" (first option) and press the ENTER key.

----

"yast2 - firewall" screen


In the list box of the left side, I select "Allowed Services" and press ENTER.

Then, on the "Service to Allow" dropdown list (on the right side), I leave the "Apache 2" option selected and press "ALt+A" to add it. After adding Apache, I'll press "Alt+S" to see the available services to add. Then, I use the down key in that list until I see "Secure Shell Server" and press ENTER to select it. This will close that list and put "Secure Shell Server" as the selected option. I'll press Alt+A again to add it.

Then I click on ALT+N click on the "Next" button.

----

"Firewall Configuration: Summary" screen

Click on the "Finish" button.

When you get sent back to the "YaST2 Control Center" screen, press ALT+Q to Quit Yast.


This time seems to be a good time to reboot your server:
|--------------------
linux-3r10:~ # reboot
|--------------------
After rebooting the machine, if you wish, you may go to another machine and connect to your newly created server using a SSH (Secure Shell) client. In Windows, I like to use putty to do ssh sessions to my Linux servers.

==== Configure Software Repositories ===

Later on, you will need to add some software packages from the openSUSE 11 Distribution. Some of those packages are NOT available in the openSUSE 11.0 DVD (libyaz-devel is one of those packages). So, we'll now set up openSUSE to add the "Official openSUSE 11.0 OSS (Open Source Software) Repository" using yast.

First, run the yast command in the Linux command line (shell):

|--------------------
# yast
|--------------------

Inside yast, select Software -> Software Repositories

=== "Configured Software Repositories" screen ===

Click on the "Add" button.


=== "Media type" screen ===


Click on the Specify URL... radio button.

Click on the "Next" button.


=== "Repository URL" screen ===


In the "Repository Name" textbox enter some descriptive text like:
openSUSE 11.0 Official OSS Repository

In the "URL" textbox enter:
http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/11.0/repo/oss/


Click on the "Next" button.


=== "License Agreement" screen ===


Check the "Yes, I Agree to the License Agreement" radio button.

Click on the "Next" button to return to the "Configured Software Repositories" screen.


=== "Configured Software Repositories" screen ===


You should see now the "openSUSE 11 Official OSS Repository" listed as an entry.

Click on the "Finish" button.

When you get sent back to the "Yast Control Center" click on the "Quit" button (to return to the shell).


==== Install some useful / necessary programs ===

By this time, I'll install some of the programs I regularly use, by using yast:


  * To install locate:
|--------------------
# yast -i findutils-locate
|--------------------
A YaST screen may appear saying:
|--------------------
Starting the Package Manager.
|--------------------
If that screen appears, it will download some information from http://download.opensuse.org (and set several Software Repositories "behind the scenes)


  * To install ncftp (command-line ftp client):
|--------------------
# yast -i ncftp
|--------------------


Install some packages that are needed to install Koha:

  * To install make :
|--------------------
# yast -i make
|--------------------

  * To install gcc :
|--------------------
# yast -i gcc
|--------------------
(this will also install some packages that gcc depend on, like glibc-devel).


==== Download Koha ====

|--------------------
# wget http://download.koha.org/koha-3.00.00-stableRC1.tar.gz
|--------------------



==== Extract Koha ====

|--------------------
# tar -xzvf koha-3.00.00.tar.gz
|--------------------


==== Set up Locale for root user ====

If you run the locale command, you'll probably get this output:
|--------------------
# locale
LANG=POSIX
LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
LC_NUMERIC="POSIX"
LC_TIME="POSIX"
LC_COLLATE="POSIX"
LC_MONETARY="POSIX"
LC_MESSAGES="POSIX"
LC_PAPER="POSIX"
LC_NAME="POSIX"
LC_ADDRESS="POSIX"
LC_TELEPHONE="POSIX"
LC_MEASUREMENT="POSIX"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="POSIX"
LC_ALL=
|--------------------

We want to have en_US.UTF-8 in all LC_* variables. So, we'll do the following:
|--------------------
# yast
|--------------------
System -> Language

The "Languages" screen should appear. 

In the first section (Primary Language Settings):

Leave "English (US)" selected as the option for Primary Language


Click on the "Details..." link

Change the Locale Settings for user root from the default option ("ctype Only") to "Yes"

Make sure the "Use UTF-8 Encoding" checkbox is checked (it should already be).

Leave the "Detailed Locale Setting" en_US selected

Click on the OK button to return to the "Languages" screen

Click on the "Accept" button.



When you get back to the "Yast2 Control Center" screen, click on the "Quit" button



==== Putty configuration to use Unicode (UTF-8 encoding) ====

If you use Putty, set up Putty to use UTF-8 encoding. To do this, click on the upper left corner of the PuTTy window, 
to expand the menu. Scroll down until you find the "Change Settings..." command and click on it.

This should open the "PuTTy Reconfiguration" screen. Here expand the "Window" category and click on "Translation"

When you do this, you'll see that the "Received data assumed to be in which character set" dropdown list probably reads:

"ISO-8859-1:1998 (Latin-1, West Europe)

change it to: "UTF-8"

Click on the "Apply" button


Now, it's a good time to SAVE this PuTTy session. To do this, click again on the upper left corner of the PuTTy window, to expand the menu, and click on the "Change Settings..." command like you did before.

This should open the "PuTTy Reconfiguration" screen. Go to the right hand side of that screen and type a name in the "Saved Sessions" textbox (e.g: koha). Then click on the "Save" button and, after doing that, click on the "Apply" button.


IMPORTANT!!! Now it's the time to EXIT the login shell, by typing the exit command:
|--------------------
# exit
|--------------------

Now you'll reopen PuTTy, but when you do that, open the Saved Session that you have created in order to use the "UTF-8" configuration you have done.


After logging in again with the root user, type the locale command again. Now it should read like the following:

|--------------------
# locale
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=
|--------------------


==== Apache configuration (for UTF-8) ====

Create a file called /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.local with vim (or your preferred text editor):
|--------------------
myhost:~ # vim /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.local
|--------------------
Add this line:
|--------------------
AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
|--------------------


==== Configure Apache to start at boot time and start the service ====
|--------------------
# chkconfig apache2 on

# service apache2 start
Starting httpd2 (prefork)                                            done
|--------------------

Go to a browser and type:

http://192.168.0.2

You should see a page that reads:

"It works!"



==== MySQL configuration ====

1 - Configure MySQL to start at boot time and start the service:
|--------------------
# chkconfig mysql on

# service mysql start
|--------------------

2 - Change the password for the "root" user of MySQL:
|--------------------
# /usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'chosenpassword'
|--------------------

3 - Check the encoding variables of MySQL

To check the encoding variables of MySQL, will type the 
show variables like 'char%'; command in a mysql prompt:
|--------------------
# mysql -p
Enter password:
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 7
Server version: 5.0.51a SUSE MySQL RPM


Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> show variables like 'char%';
+--------------------------+----------------------------+
| Variable_name            | Value                      |
+--------------------------+----------------------------+
| character_set_client     | latin1                     |
| character_set_connection | latin1                     |
| character_set_database   | latin1                     |
| character_set_filesystem | binary                     |
| character_set_results    | latin1                     |
| character_set_server     | latin1                     |
| character_set_system     | utf8                       |
| character_sets_dir       | /usr/share/mysql/charsets/ |
+--------------------------+----------------------------+
8 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> quit
Bye
|--------------------

We want to have utf8 in the above character_set_* variables above (and NOT latin1)!

In order to do this:

1 - Create a backup of the MySQL configuration file (my.cnf):
|--------------------
# cd /etc
myhost:/etc # cp my.cnf my.cnf.ORIG
|--------------------

2 - Use vim to add these 3 lines in the section [mysqld] of the my.cnf file:
|--------------------
default-character-set = utf8
character-set-server = utf8
skip-character-set-client-handshake
|--------------------

3 - Restart MySQL:
|--------------------
myhost:/etc # service mysql restart
Restarting service MySQL
Shutting down service MySQL                                           done
Starting service MySQL                                                done
|--------------------

Now, let's type again the show variables like 'char%' mysql command to see if 
the character_set_variables have changed from latin1 to utf8 (character_set_filesystem 
will still read "binary" but I think that's OK:
|--------------------
myhost:/etc # mysql -p
Enter password:
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 1
Server version: 5.0.51a SUSE MySQL RPM


Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> show variables like 'char%';
+--------------------------+----------------------------+
| Variable_name            | Value                      |
+--------------------------+----------------------------+
| character_set_client     | utf8                       |
| character_set_connection | utf8                       |
| character_set_database   | utf8                       |
| character_set_filesystem | binary                     |
| character_set_results    | utf8                       |
| character_set_server     | utf8                       |
| character_set_system     | utf8                       |
| character_sets_dir       | /usr/share/mysql/charsets/ |
+--------------------------+----------------------------+
8 rows in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> quit
Bye
|--------------------

==== Create the Koha database ====

=== Create the koha database and user with associated privileges ===
|--------------------
# mysqladmin -uroot create koha -p 
|--------------------
(you may name the koha database something different from koha)


=== Grant privileges to a MySQL user to the koha database === 

Assuming that you want to have a MySQL user called "kohaadmin" to administer a database called "koha" with the password "kohapassword", you'd enter this:
|--------------------
myhost:~ # mysql -p
Enter password:
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 3
Server version: 5.0.51a SUSE MySQL RPM

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> grant all on koha.* to 'kohaadmin'@'localhost' identified by 'kohapassword';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> flush privileges;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.08 sec)

mysql> quit
Bye
|--------------------


==== Test your SAX Parser and correct where necessary ====


  * Install the XML::SAX and XML::LibXML perl Modules:
|--------------------
# yast -i perl-XML-SAX 

# yast -i perl-XML-LibXML
|--------------------

You must be sure you're using the XML::LibXML SAX parser, not Expat or PurePerl, both of which have outstanding bugs with pre-composed characters. You can test your SAX parser by running:
|--------------------
# cd /root/koha-3.00.00/

myhost:~/koha-3.00.00 # misc/sax_parser_print.pl 
|--------------------

You will probably see this:
|--------------------
XML::SAX::PurePerl=HASH(0x8356a4c)
|--------------------

If you're using PurePerl (you probably are) or Expat, you'll need to edit your ParserDetails.ini file to use the LibXML Parser. 
To find the ParserDetails.ini file, you may use locate. To do this, first update the locate database by running the updatedb command:
|--------------------
# updatedb
|--------------------

Then find ParserDetails.ini using locate:
|--------------------
# locate ParserDetails.ini
/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.10.0/XML/SAX/ParserDetails.ini
|--------------------

OK. So, let's first do a backup of this ini file:
|--------------------
 # cd /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.10.0/XML/SAX/

myhost:/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.10.0/XML/SAX # cp ParserDetails.ini ParserDetails.ini.ORIG
|--------------------

Edit this ParserDetails.ini file (with vim or other editor)

See if the first line contains this:
|--------------------
[XML::SAX::PurePerl]
|--------------------
If it does, replace this first line by the following:
|--------------------
[XML::LibXML::SAX::Parser]
|--------------------

Run the /root/koha-3.00.00/misc/sax_parser_print.pl command again. This time, you should get the following output:
|--------------------
XML::LibXML::SAX::Parser=HASH(0x8356e0c)
|--------------------


==== Run Koha's perl installer ====
|--------------------
myhost:/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.10.0/XML/SAX # cd /root/koha-3.00.00
|--------------------
We will now run perl Makefile.PL to run the installer. 

My installation is a UNIMARC installation, so I'm answering unimarc to the "MARC format for Zebra indexing (marc21, unimarc) [marc21]" question below. If your Library uses the MARC21 format instead of UNIMARC, you should press ENTER to accept the default (which is marc21).

|--------------------
myhost:~/koha-3.00.00 # perl Makefile.PL

By default, Koha can be installed in one of three ways:

standard: Install files in conformance with the Filesystem
          Hierarchy Standard (FHS).  This is the default mode
          and should be used when installing a production
          Koha system.  On Unix systems, root access is
          needed to complete a standard installation.

single:   Install files under a single directory.  This option
          is useful for installing Koha without root access, e.g.,
          on a web host that allows CGI scripts and MySQL databases
          but requires the user to keep all files under the user's
          HOME directory.

dev:      Create a set of symbolic links and configuration files to
          allow Koha to run directly from the source distribution.
          This mode is useful for developers who want to run
          Koha from a git clone.

Installation mode (dev, single, standard) [standard]


Please specify the directory under which most Koha files
will be installed.

Note that if you are planning in installing more than
one instance of Koha, you may want to modify the last
component of the directory path, which will be used
as the package name in the FHS layout.

Base installation directory [/usr/share/koha]


Since you are using the 'standard' install
mode, you should run 'make install' as root.
However, it is recommended that a non-root
user (on Unix and Linux platforms) have
ownership of Koha's files, including the
Zebra indexes if applicable.

Please specify a user account.  This
user account does not need to exist
right now, but it needs to exist
before you run 'make install'.  Please
note that for security reasons, this
user should not be the same as the user
account Apache runs under.

User account [koha]

Please specify the group that should own
Koha's files.  As above, this group need
not exist right now, but should be created
before you run 'make install'.

Group [koha]

Please specify which database engine you will use
to store data in Koha.  The choices are MySQL and
PostgreSQL; please note that at the moment
PostgreSQL support is highly experimental.

DBMS to use (Pg, mysql) [mysql]


Please specify the name or address of your
database server.  Note that the database
does not have to exist at this point, it
can be created after running 'make install'
and before you try using Koha for the first time.

Database server [localhost]

Please specify the port used to connect to the
DMBS [3306]

Please specify the name of the database to be
used by Koha [koha]

Please specify the user that owns the database to be
used by Koha [kohaadmin]

Please specify the password of the user that owns the
database to be used by Koha [katikoan] kohapassword

Koha can use the Zebra search engine for high-performance
searching of bibliographic and authority records.  If you
have installed the Zebra software and would like to use it,
please answer 'yes' to the following question.  Otherwise,
Koha will default to using its internal search engine.

Please note that if you choose *NOT* to install Zebra,
koha-conf.xml will still contain some references to Zebra
settings.  Those references will be ignored by Koha.

Install the Zebra configuration files? (no, yes) [yes] yes


Since you've chosen to use Zebra with Koha,
you must specify the primary MARC format of the
records to be indexed by Zebra.

Koha provides Zebra configuration files for MARC 21
and UNIMARC.

MARC format for Zebra indexing (marc21, unimarc) [marc21] unimarc


Koha supplies Zebra configuration files tuned for
searching either English (en) or French (fr) MARC
records.

Primary language for Zebra indexing (en, fr) [en] fr

Koha can use one of  two different indexing modes
for the MARC authorities records:

grs1 - uses the Zebra GRS-1 filter, available
       for legacy support
dom  - uses the DOM XML filter; offers improved
       functionality.

Authorities indexing mode (dom, grs1) [grs1] dom


Please specify Zebra database user [kohauser]


Please specify the Zebra database password [zebrastripes] zebrapassword


Since you've chosen to use Zebra, you can enable the SRU/
Z39.50 Server if you so choose, but you must specify a
few configuration options for it.

Please note that if you choose *NOT* to configure SRU,
koha-conf.xml will still contain some references to SRU
settings.  Those references will be ignored by Koha.

Install the SRU configuration files? (no, yes) [yes] no


Since you've chosen to use Zebra, you can also choose to
install PazPar2, which is a metasearch tool.  With PazPar2,
Koha can perform on-the-fly merging of bibliographic
records during searching, allowing for FRBRization of
the results list.

Install the PazPar2 configuration files? [no]

Would you like to run the database-dependent test suite? (no, yes) [no]

Writing Makefile for koha

myhost:~/koha-3.00.00 #
|--------------------

OK... Lots of missing dependencies (Perl Modules). Let's build some of these modules in CPAN to fix this:


==== CPAN Configuration ====
If you don't already know, "CPAN is the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a large collection of Perl software and documentation". For additional info, you may browse the official CPAN web site is at http://www.cpan.org/

Enter the "cpan" command to configure CPAN:
|--------------------
myhost:~/koha-3.00.00 # cpan


CPAN is the world-wide archive of perl resources. It consists of about
300 sites that all replicate the same contents around the globe. Many
countries have at least one CPAN site already. The resources found on
CPAN are easily accessible with the CPAN.pm module. If you want to use
CPAN.pm, lots of things have to be configured. Fortunately, most of
them can be determined automatically. If you prefer the automatic
configuration, answer 'yes' below.

If you prefer to enter a dialog instead, you can answer 'no' to this
question and I'll let you configure in small steps one thing after the
other. (Note: you can revisit this dialog anytime later by typing 'o
conf init' at the cpan prompt.)
Would you like me to configure as much as possible automatically? [yes]
|--------------------

[Just press ENTER here to set all CPAN settings to the default values. 
After doing this CPAN will scroll lots of messages with questions that 
it will automatically answer]

[Let's now set up CPAN for Internet access to enable it to download packages. 
Because I live in Portugal, I'm choosing Portuguese mirrors here. Choose the 
mirrors that are nearer to you:]

|--------------------
cpan[2]> o conf init urllist
You have no /root/.cpan/sources/MIRRORED.BY
  I'm trying to fetch one
CPAN: LWP::UserAgent loaded ok (v5.810)

I would like to connect to one of the following sites to get 'MIRRORED.BY':

 http://www.perl.org/CPAN/
 ftp://ftp.perl.org/pub/CPAN/

Is it OK to try to connect to the Internet? [yes]
Fetching with LWP:
  http://www.perl.org/CPAN/MIRRORED.BY


Now we need to know where your favorite CPAN sites are located. Push
a few sites onto the array (just in case the first on the array won't
work). If you are mirroring CPAN to your local workstation, specify a
file: URL.

First, pick a nearby continent and country by typing in the number(s)
in front of the item(s) you want to select. You can pick several of
each, separated by spaces. Then, you will be presented with a list of
URLs of CPAN mirrors in the countries you selected, along with
previously selected URLs. Select some of those URLs, or just keep the
old list. Finally, you will be prompted for any extra URLs -- file:,
ftp:, or http: -- that host a CPAN mirror.

(1) Africa
(2) Asia
(3) Central America
(4) Europe
(5) North America
(6) Oceania
(7) South America
Select your continent (or several nearby continents) [] 4

Select your country (or several nearby countries) []
Sorry! since you don't have any existing picks, you must make a
geographic selection.

(5) ftp://neacm.fe.up.pt/pub/CPAN/
(6) ftp://perl.di.uminho.pt/pub/CPAN/
(7) http://cpan.dcc.fc.up.pt/
Select as many URLs as you like (by number),
put them on one line, separated by blanks, hyphenated ranges allowed
 e.g. '1 4 5' or '7 1-4 8' [] 3 2 6 4 5 7 1

Enter another URL or RETURN to quit: []
New set of picks:

|--------------------

  * Installing libyaz and libyaz-devel for Net::Z3950::ZOOM
OK... So we ran through a problem with a missing "yaz-config" while installing Net::Z3950::ZOOM. To solve this, let's first install the libyaz package:
|--------------------
# yast -i libyaz
|--------------------
[This will also install 1 dependency: libxslt]

We also have to install another package:libyaz-devel. libyaz-devel is NOT available in the openSUSE 11 DVD but it is available in the Official openSUSE 11 OSS Repository. If you have skipped that step, add that repository in yast first.

  * Install the libyaz-devel package:
|--------------------
# yast -i libyaz-devel
|--------------------
(If the above command does not work, you probably did not set up the "Official openSUSE 11.0 OSS Repository". See the "Configure Software Repositories" section earlier in this document that explains how you set up it inside yast).

Installing libyaz-devel will also add some other packages that libyaz-devel depends on, namely: 
zlib-devel, tcpd-devel, tack, libgpg-error-devel, ncurses-devel, libopenssl-devel, libgcrypt-devel, readline-devel, libxml2-devel and libxslt-devel.


Let's now install the Net::Z3950::ZOOM Module

== Run "make install" ==

Even with these errors in C4::Labels, we will run make install:

|--------------------
myhost:~/Koha # make install
|--------------------
[Several lines starting with "Manifying" and many lines starting with "Installing" will scroll by...]
|--------------------
Installing /usr/share/koha/man/man3/cataloguing::value_builder::marc21_leader_computerfile.3pm
Installing /usr/share/koha/man/man3/opac::opac-tags.3pm
Installing /usr/share/koha/man/man3/cataloguing::value_builder::unimarc_field_123j.3pm
Installing /usr/share/koha/man/man3/cataloguing::value_builder::marc21_field_003.3pm
Installing /usr/share/koha/man/man3/authorities::detail.3pm

Koha's files have now been installed.

In order to use Koha's command-line batch jobs,
you should set the following environment variables:

export KOHA_CONF=/etc/koha/koha-conf.xml
export PERL5LIB=/usr/share/koha/lib

For other post-installation tasks, please consult the README.


# cd /etc
myhost:/etc #
|--------------------

==== Create /etc/bash.bashrc.local ====
Create a file called bash.bashrc.local in the /etc directory:
|--------------------
myhost:/etc # vim /etc/bash.bashrc.local
|--------------------
add these 2 lines in the file:
|--------------------
export KOHA_CONF=/etc/koha/koha-conf.xml
export PERL5LIB=/usr/share/koha/lib
|--------------------

- EXIT THE SHELL AND LOG BACK IN.
|--------------------
myhost:/etc # exit
|--------------------
After logging back in, type the following commands to check if 
the KOHA_CONF and PERL5LIB environment variables have been correctly set:
|--------------------
myhost:~ # env | grep KOHA
KOHA_CONF=/etc/koha/koha-conf.xml

myhost:~ # env | grep PERL5LIB
PERL5LIB=/usr/share/koha/lib
|--------------------

=== Koha's Web Installer ===

Access Koha's web installer at:

http://192.168.0.2:8080/

Your browser will probably say that:
|--------------------
" The server at 192.168.0.2 is taking too long to respond."
|--------------------
OK... It seems that we have to do some things yet.


== Create a symbolic link to /etc/koha/koha-httpd.conf ==

Let's create a symbolic link to the /etc/koha/koha-httpd.conf file in the /etc/apache2/vhosts.d directory:
|--------------------
myhost:~ # cd /etc/apache2/vhosts.d/

myhost:/etc/apache2/vhosts.d # ln -s /etc/koha/koha-httpd.conf koha-httpd.conf
|--------------------

  * Restart Apache
|--------------------
myhost:/etc/apache2/conf.d # service apache2 restart
Syntax error on line 28 of /etc/apache2/conf.d/koha-httpd.conf:
Invalid command 'RewriteEngine', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
|--------------------


== Enable the mod_rewrite Apache module ==

OK... It seems that we need to enable the mod_rewrite Apache module:
|--------------------
myhost:/etc/sysconfig # a2enmod rewrite
|--------------------
[If the above command seems NOT to work, for some reason, do this - edit /etc/sysconfig/apache2 and add rewrite at the end of the APACHE_MODULES line, right before the right quote]
|--------------------
myhost:/etc/sysconfig # service apache2 restart
Syntax OK
Shutting down httpd2 (waiting for all children to terminate)         done
Starting httpd2 (prefork)                                            done
|--------------------

== Change koha-httpd.conf ==

If you browsed again to http://192.168.0.2:8080 you would still get no answer. This is because we still have to do some changes to the koha-httpd.conf file.

First, let's create a backup of this file:
|--------------------
myhost:/etc/apache2/vhosts.d # cp koha-httpd.conf koha-httpd.conf.ORIG


myhost:/etc/koha # vim koha-httpd.conf
|--------------------

At the beginning of the koha-httpd.conf file, under the commented NameVirtualHost line, add the following line:
|--------------------
Listen 8080
|--------------------
In that file, you should find two VirtualHost sections: one for the OPAC area of Koha and the other one for the Intranet. 
If the two virtualHost directives - the lines that start with <nowiki><VirtualHost</nowiki> - in that file are set for the IP Address 127.0.0.2, replace them by the correct IP address of your server.

That file will have 2 ServerName directives (one for each of the 2 VirtualHosts). In those directives, you should have the IP of your server -or- the FQDN of your server (example: ServerName www.koha.test).

|--------------------
myhost:/etc/koha # service apache2 restart
Syntax OK
Shutting down httpd2 (waiting for all children to terminate)         done
Starting httpd2 (prefork)                                            done
|--------------------


Try to access the web page:

http://192.168.0.2/

If you get again the "It Works!" web page, you'll probably have to Refresh/Reload the page in your browser (press the F5 key).

After reloading the page, you should get the following error:
|--------------------
Forbidden

You don't have permission to access / on this server.

Additionally, a 403 Forbidden error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.
Apache/2.2.4 (Linux/SUSE) Server at 192.168.0.2 Port 8080
|--------------------

OK. Let's add then the following directive at the end of the koha-httpd.conf file:
|--------------------
<Directory /usr/share/koha>
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
</Directory>
|--------------------

Restart Apache:
|--------------------
myhost:/etc/apache2/vhosts.d # service apache2 restart
Syntax OK
Shutting down httpd2 (waiting for all children to terminate)         done
Starting httpd2 (prefork)                                            done
|--------------------

OK. Load again the following page in your web browser:

http://192.168.0.2

After some seconds you should be redirected to:

http://192.168.0.2/cgi-bin/koha/maintenance.pl


and see a Koha page saying:
|--------------------
"System Maintenance ... we'll be back soon! If you have any questions, please contact the Site Administrator"
|--------------------

This is actually GOOD NEWS!  :)  It's now time to set up Koha in the Intranet interface.


To do that, browse to:


http://192.168.0.2:8080

== Enable port 8080 in the firewall ==

After a while the page will probably time out. This is because we now have to allow the 8080 port in the firewall.

Let's run yast and do that:
|--------------------
myhost:/etc/apache2/vhosts.d # yast
|--------------------
Inside yast, go to "Security and Users" -> "Firewall"

Scroll down to "Allowed Services" on the right side and press ENTER

Press TAB several times until you reach the "Apache2" allowed service on the right side. When you do that, 
press Alt+d to click the "Advanced..." button.

A new window should open. Press Alt+T to go to the "TCP Ports" text box and enter the following values in that box:
80 8080

Press Alt+O to click the OK button. That will send you back to the "Firewall Configuration:Allowed Services" 
screen. Press Alt+N to click the "Next" button. 

You should now be in the "Firewall Configuration: Summary" screen. Press "Alt+F" to Finish.

You should now be again in the "YaST Control Center" screen. Press "Alt+Q" to quit yast.


Go again to:

http://192.168.0.2:8080/

... you should get redirected to:

http://192.168.0.2:8080/cgi-bin/koha/installer/install.pl

... and see a page with the Koha Logo and the heading: "Welcome to the Koha Web Installer"!  :)


You may now login with your koha administrator username and password and reply to the several questions you will be asked.
