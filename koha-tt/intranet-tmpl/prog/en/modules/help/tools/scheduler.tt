<h1>Task Scheduler</h1>
<p>The task scheduler is a way to schedule reports to run whenever
      you want.</p><p>To schedule a task, visit the Task Scheduler and fill in the
      form</p>
      <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Current Server Time shows the time on your server (schedule
          all of your reports to run based on that time - not on your local
          time)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Time should be entered as hh:mm (2 digit hour, 2 digit
          minute)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Date should be entered using the calendar pop up</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>From Report choose the report you want to schedule</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Choose whether to receive the text of or a link to the
          results</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In the Email filed enter the email of the person you want to
          receive your report</p></li></ul><p>Below the task scheduler form, there is a list of scheduled
      reports</p>
      <p>You can also schedule reports directly from the list of saved
      reports by clicking the 'Schedule' link</p>
      <h3>Troubleshooting</h3><p>Task scheduler will not work if the user the webserver runs as
        doesn't have the permission to use it. To find out if the right user
        has the permissions necessary, check /etc/at.allow to see what users
        are in it. If you don't have that file, check etc/at.deny. If at.deny
        exists but is blank, then every user can use it. Talk to your system
        admin about adding the user to the right place to make the task
        scheduler work.</p>
